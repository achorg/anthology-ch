<p>The Anthology for Computers and the Humanities builds on developments
across academia. Papers presented at academic conferences and workshops
are frequently made publicly available in the form of proceedings.
Proceedings can be published as a special issue or section of an
existing journal, as a printed book, or—as is increasingly the case in
many fields—in special-purpose digital publication venues. Proceedings
enable the rapid dissemination and citation of work that has been
presented to and reviewed by experts within a field, both for those
attending the event in person and for others who read the proceedings
after the conference has concluded. Papers within proceedings are
frequently peer-reviewed as part of the conference itself and are
written in formats that can be easily adapted to archival forms, such as
LaTeX converted to PDF or Markdown converted to PDF or HTML. Papers
typically do not go through extensive third-party copyediting. These
features make proceedings ideal for quickly disseminating research in an
open platform.</p>
<p>The role of conference proceedings differs significantly across
fields <span class="citation"
data-cites="kochetkov2021importance">[5]</span>. In many social sciences
domains, proceedings are considered precursors to longer papers in
journals, with proceedings treated as working drafts rather than
independent publications <span class="citation"
data-cites="lisee2008conference">[6]</span>. Proceedings from
mathematics and statistics conferences, when produced, are often treated
as supplementary details that contain technical proofs and information
that cannot be included in the presentations themselves. Within some
subfields of philology and linguistics, proceedings are edited,
published, and "counted" as equivalent to chapters in edited volumes. In
computer science, proceedings have taken a particularly prominent role
in their respective fields <span class="citation"
data-cites="vrettas2015conferences">[8]</span>. Across almost every
subfield of computer science, papers published in conferences have
become the de facto form of publication over the past several
decades.</p>
<p>Scholarly associations frequently host open platforms for conference
proceedings, providing access to cutting-edge research before, during,
or right after the conference. The Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), for example, hosts a Conference
Proceedings platform that hosts proceedings dating back to 1936. The
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) also manages the International
Conference Proceeding Series, which is reported to receive an average of
4.4 million page views and 1.75 million downloads per month. The AIP
Conference Proceedings, published by the American Institute of Physics,
and the Association for Computational Linguistics' ACL Anthology provide
similar structures within their respective fields. Platforms provided by
scholarly associations typically offer many of the same bibliometric
tools provided by journals, such as DOIs, a top-level ISSN, and
inclusion in research search aggregator tools <span class="citation"
data-cites="anderson2012towards">[1]</span>. A limitation of these
platforms hosted by scholarly associations, however, is that their
disciplinary focus may make them less suitable for research situated
outside their core fields.</p>
<p>As an alternative to dedicated platforms for publishing proceedings,
many conferences post PDF files of papers directly on their website or
link to general-purpose archival platforms such as arXiv or Zenodo.
These options are most popular with fields that treat proceedings as
grey literature, which are distinct from research published in journal
articles and printed books. Publishing directly on a conference website
offers an easy and inexpensive way of making conference proceedings
available without the support of a scholarly association. However, this
comes along with many downsides. The conference site may only continue
to exist for a short time, making papers only temporarily available, and
does not come along with the kinds of bibliometric tools that are
important to making research findable, and are often essential for
research to "count" as published research for the authors. While
augmenting these direct links with general-purpose archival sites such
as Zenodo or arXiv provides some level of long-term access and
persistent identifiers, the fact that anyone can upload their materials
to these sites without any form of peer review causes challenges for
considering such work as formal research outputs. The Anthology for
Computers and the Humanities builds on the opportunities afforded by
models across academia to support peer-reviewed, open access research
published on a timeline that aligns with computationally-infused
research to maximize our scholarship's impact <span class="citation"

<h1 data-number="2"
id="state-of-conference-proceedings-in-the-digital-humanities"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> State of Conference Proceedings
in the Digital Humanities</h1>
<p>Digital humanities (DH), a term we intend in its most inclusive and
generous sense, has no broadly accepted stance on the role of conference
proceedings within the field. This is not particularly surprising since
DH brings together scholars and scholarship from across fields ranging
from the humanities to computer science, which, as described above, have
very different norms surrounding the status of conference proceedings as
research. We are aware of at least four different models that
DH-oriented conferences have used to disseminate conference proceedings
materials online:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>None.</strong> Many conferences publish only presentation
titles and (possibly) abstracts on their websites, avoiding any creation
of full proceedings. For example, this approach is also taken by the
most recent installations of the ACH’s annual conference.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Archiving</strong>. Other conferences publish
submissions presented at their conferences on their websites. This is
the format used, for example, by recent annual ADHO conferences, which
creates a book of abstracts. The status of these as citable,
peer-reviewed publications can be unclear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CS workshops</strong>. Within computer science, many
conferences allow proposals for co-located workshops. Papers presented
at these workshops must adhere to the rules of the leading conference
and can often be published through institutionally backed platforms used
for the main conference proceedings. Recent examples include the
LaTeCH-CLfL 2025 workshop, co-located with NAACL, which publishes
proceedings to the ACL Anthology, and the VIS4DH 2025 workshop,
co-located with IEEE VIS, which publishes proceedings to the Proceedings
of the IEEE.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dedicated Volumes in CS Proceedings</strong>. The
Computational Humanities Research (CHR) conference published complete
conference proceedings in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings from 2020
through 2024.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Special Issues.</strong> Another format used for some
conferences is to publish papers within a special issue of a journal.
This seems less common in recent years because it requires a lot of work
for everyone involved. Previous examples include the special issues of
Digital Humanities Quarterly, which published papers from BeNeLux 2017,
and the Göttingen Dialog in Digital Humanities in 2015 and
2016.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The examples above only include conference proceedings that directly
publish papers as accepted to a given event. Many events subsequently
invite presenters to revise their work for inclusion in related
publications, such as a special issue of <em>Digital Scholarship in the
Humanities</em> dedicated to an ADHO conference and issues of the <em>DH
Benelux Journal</em>. These publications require additional writing and
peer-review processes and therefore function more like regular journal
articles than conference proceedings.</p>
<p>All the examples cited above are reasonable approaches in many
situations, depending on the needs and goals of the conference
organizers and the communities in which they are situated. For example,
a workshop seeking to engage with practitioners in computer science may
find co-locating with a computer science conference to be an ideal
situation. Likewise, a community that encourages the rapid revision of
papers for a special issue of a focused journal may decide that
publishing conference proceedings is a hindrance to subsequent
publications. Offering a self-archiving option with limited
bibliographic support can, similarly, be a valuable compromise for
making work accessible without limiting the impact of subsequent
publications.</p>
<p>In many cases, however, the options listed above simply represent the
best available alternatives among those currently accessible to the DH
community. Additionally, even in cases where these options may appear
promising, they may not be accessible to everyone. To be included as a
computer science workshop requires a clear computer science focus and
cannot be designed around a geographical community. The Computational
Humanities Research team was recently informed that they would no longer
be able to publish in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Finally, the
Digital Humanities Quarterly no longer accepts proposals with a "purely
event-based focus." There is a clear need for another option.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="goals-and-structure-of-the-anthology"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Goals and Structure of the
Anthology</h1>
<p>The <em>Anthology of Computers and the Humanities</em> provides the
DH community with a platform for publishing conference and workshop
proceedings. We are guided by a strong commitment to broad
accessibility, both in terms of the content we publish and how it is
accessed. The <em>Anthology</em> is accessible online with no sign-in
required to access the research and no author contribution fees.</p>
<p>All events of various sizes and from any of the broadly defined areas
of DH are welcome to publish proceedings. Every volume of the
<em>Anthology</em> corresponds to the proceedings from a specific event.
The organizers of the event serve as, or select, the volume editors and
will have complete editorial control over the content of the papers
published in their volume. The volume editors are invited, but not
required, to include an introductory article to serve as context for the
volume. Any group can submit proposals for volumes in the anthology,
provided that the papers will undergo a peer-review process and that the
event has an open call for participation. We expect that all proposals
for volumes that meet the stated guidelines will be accepted for
inclusion in the <em>Anthology</em>.</p>
<p>We have designed the Anthology to maximize the findability and
accessibility of all papers. Papers appearing in the <em>Anthology</em>
will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
license (CC-BY 4.0), which permits all reuse as long as the authors are
properly cited. Copyright for the paper remains with the authors.
Through an institutional license from the non-profit organization
Crossref, we will be able to offer dedicated DOIs for every paper and
ensure inclusion in all major research aggregators <span
class="citation"
data-cites="chandrakar2006digital hendricks2020crossref">[3],
[4]</span>. Additionally, we will support integration and linked data
using ORCIDs and a top-level ISSN for the publication. These
bibliographic tools enhance the findability of papers published in the
Anthology and facilitate authors' ability to receive academic credit for
their publications through their own national and institutional
frameworks. Because we want papers to be easy to cite, ready-to-use
citation fields are provided on every article page, along with a
site-wide, comprehensive, downloadable BibTeX file containing citations
to all published papers from the <em>Anthology</em>. Papers will be made
available as downloadable PDFs for archival purposes and searchable HTML
for findability.</p>
<p>Organizationally, the <em>Anthology</em> operates as an independently
managed sub-entity under the Association for Computers and the
Humanities (ACH). This structure follows the standard format of computer
science proceedings published by scholarly associations, providing a
platform to operate immediately within an existing non-profit
organization. ACH has generously provided the funds and infrastructure
that have allowed the <em>Anthology</em> to operate without charging any
publication costs to authors or organizations. While the ACH is a
US-based professional society, the <em>Anthology</em> encourages
contributions from all geographic regions and welcomes papers and
volumes in any language.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="sec:conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Looking Ahead</h1>
<p>We hope that the <em>Anthology of Computers and the Humanities</em>
makes an essential contribution to DH by providing all interested
members of the community with access to an open publication platform,
through which they can share their work. The roles of conference
proceedings and even conferences themselves will, as always, continue to
evolve. We are committed to the long-term preservation of published
volumes in the <em>Anthology</em>. We are excited to continue adapting
as we aim to help enable, acknowledge, and amplify the research being
done within our community.</p>
