While each language is subject to specific social, demographic and political pressures, there may also be common threatening processes. We use an analysis of 6,511 spoken languages with 51 predictor variables spanning aspects of population, documentation, legal recognition, education policy, socioeconomic indicators and environmental features to show that, counter to common perception, contact with other languages per se is not a driver of language loss. However, greater road density, which may encourage population movement, is associated with increased endangerment. Higher average years of schooling is also associated with greater endangerment, evidence that formal education can contribute to loss of language diversity. Without intervention, language loss could triple within 40 years, with at least one language lost per month. To avoid the loss of over 1,500 languages by the end of the century, urgent investment is needed in language documentation, bilingual education programmes and other community-based programmes.}, number={2}, journal={Nature Ecology \& Evolution}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Bromham, Lindell and Dinnage, Russell and Skirgård, Hedvig and Ritchie, Andrew and Cardillo, Marcel and Meakins, Felicity and Greenhill, Simon and Hua, Xia}, year={2022}, pages={163–173}, language={en} }

At the same time, the demand for cross-linguistic datasets has been increasing, as witnessed by numerous studies devoted to diverse questions on human prehistory, cultural evolution, and human cognition. Unfortunately, most published datasets lack standardization which makes their comparison difficult. Here, we present a new approach to increase the comparability of cross-linguistic lexical data. We have designed workflows for the computer-assisted lifting of datasets to Cross-Linguistic Data Formats, a collection of standards that make these datasets more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). We test the Lexibank workflow on 100 lexical datasets from which we derive an aggregated database of wordlists in unified phonetic transcriptions covering more than 2000 language varieties. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by showing how phonological and lexical features can be automatically inferred, complementing and expanding existing cross-linguistic datasets.}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Data}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={List, Johann-Mattis and Forkel, Robert and Greenhill, Simon J. and Rzymski, Christoph and Englisch, Johannes and Gray, Russell D.}, year={2022}, pages={316}, language={en}, number = {9}}

ISSN={1939-9170},
DOI={10.1890/10-2402.1},
abstractNote={Realistic measures of biodiversity should reflect not only the relative abundances of species, but also the differences between them. We present a natural family of diversity measures taking both factors into account. This is not just another addition to the already long list of diversity indices. Instead, a single formula subsumes many of the most popular indices, including Shannon’s, Simpson’s, species richness, and Rao’s quadratic entropy. These popular indices can then be used and understood in a unified way, and the relationships between them are made plain. The new measures are, moreover, effective numbers, so that percentage changes and ratio comparisons of diversity value are meaningful. We advocate the use of diversity profiles, which provide a faithful graphical representation of the shape of a community; they show how the perceived diversity changes as the emphasis shifts from rare to common species. Communities can usefully be compared by comparing their diversity profiles. We show by example that this is a far more subtle method than any relying on a single statistic. Some ecologists view diversity indices with suspicion, questioning whether they are biologically meaningful. By dropping the naive assumption that distinct species have nothing in common, working with effective numbers, and using diversity profiles, we arrive at a system of diversity measurement that should lay much of this suspicion to rest.},

ISSN={2013-2247},
abstractNote={Mutual intelligibility between speakers of four related language varieties spoken in the northern half of the island of Pentecost in Vanuatu (Raga, Suru Kavian, Suru Rabwanga and Suru Mwerani) is investigated. Raga is a separate language spoken in the northernmost part of Pentecost and is intelligible to varying degrees to speakers of the other three varieties. The other three varieties are considered dialects of the same language, Apma. However, intelligibility between the dialects is asymmetric. Although Suru Kavian speakers claim to understand Suru Rabwanga and Suru Mwerani without difficulty, speakers of the latter two varieties maintain that they have significant problems understanding Suru Kavian. These claims are supported by the results.To explain the intelligibility results they were correlated with quantitative measures of linguistic (phonetic and lexical distances) and non-linguistic (geographical distances and a measure of exposure) factors that may play a role in mutual intelligibility.},

Drawing on the ecological literature, it proposes an adaptation to languages of the classic distinction between “alpha” (intra-setting), “beta” (inter-setting) and “gamma” (system-level) diversity. We begin by discussing some of the general challenges raised by the measurement of diversity. We review received approaches to the measurement of diversity resting on the concepts of richness and evenness, highlighting some limitations that come to the fore when comparing the respective diversity of different settings and systems. In order to overcome some of these limitations, we adapt the concept of “numbers equivalent” to linguistic diversity measurement indices. On this basis, we derive a multi-level approach to diversity measurement. We provide numerical examples to highlight the properties of this model before discussing its application to language policy issues.}, number={2}, journal={Social Indicators Research}, author={Grin, François and Fürst, Guillaume}, year={2022}, month=nov, pages={601–621}, language={en} }

It cannot be used everywhere, as it does not always give values which are independent of sample size ; it cannot do so, for example, when applied to an infinite population of individuals classified into a finite number of groups.

There is a spectrum of viewpoints on diversity, indexed by a real parameter q giving greater or lesser importance to rare species. Leinster and Cobbold (2012) proposed a one-parameter family of diversity measures taking into account both this variation and the varying similarities between species. Because of this latter feature, diversity is not maximized by the uniform distribution on species. So it is natural to ask: which distributions maximize diversity, and what is its maximum value? In principle, both answers depend on q, but our main theorem is that neither does. Thus, there is a single distribution that maximizes diversity from all viewpoints simultaneously, and any list of species has an unambiguous maximum diversity value. Furthermore, the maximizing distribution(s) can be computed in finite time, and any distribution maximizing diversity from some particular viewpoint actually maximizes diversity for all q. Although we phrase our results in ecological terms, they apply very widely, with applications in graph theory and metric geometry.}, number={3}, journal={Entropy}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Leinster, Tom and Meckes, Mark W.}, year={2016}, month=mar, pages={88}, language={en} }

He collected comparative word lists for various languages during his voyages aboard the Astrolabe from 1826 to 1829 and, in his work concerning the geographical division of the Pacific, he proposed a method for measuring the degree of relation among languages. The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Morris Swadesh in the 1950s, measures distances from the percentage of shared cognates, which are words with a common historical origin. Recently, we proposed a new automated method which uses the normalized Levenshtein distances among words with the same meaning and averages on the words contained in a list. Recently another group of scholars, Bakker et al. (2009) [8] and Holman et al. (2008) [9], proposed a refined version of our definition including a second normalization. In this paper we compare the information content of our definition with the refined version in order to decide which of the two can be applied with greater success to resolve relationships among languages.}, number={11}, journal={Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications}, author={Petroni, Filippo and Serva, Maurizio}, year={2010}, month=jun, pages={2280–2283} }
