              Linking named entities occurring in text to their corresponding entity in a Knowledge Base (KB) is challenging, especially when dealing with historical texts. In this work, we introduce Musical Heritage named Entities Recognition, Classification and Linking (
              mhercl
              ), a novel benchmark consisting of manually annotated sentences extrapolated from historical periodicals of the music domain.
              mhercl
              contains named entities under-represented or absent in the most famous KBs. We experiment with several State-of-the-Art models on the Entity Linking (EL) task and show that
              mhercl
              is a challenging dataset for all of them. We propose a novel unsupervised EL model and a method to extend supervised entity linkers by using Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to tackle the main difficulties posed by historical documents. Our experiments reveal that relying on unsupervised techniques and improving models with logical constraints based on KGs and heuristics to predict  entities (entities not represented in the KB of reference) results in better EL performance on historical documents.},

While prior work on Classical languages unanimously uses BERT, in this work we create four language models for Ancient Greek that vary along two dimensions to study their versatility for tasks of interest for Classical languages: we explore (i) encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures using RoBERTa and T5 as strong model types, and create for each of them (ii) a monolingual Ancient Greek and a multilingual instance that includes Latin and English. We evaluate all models on morphological and syntactic tasks, including lemmatization, which demonstrates the added value of T5’s decoding abilities. We further define two probing tasks to investigate the knowledge acquired by models pre-trained on Classical texts. Our experiments provide the first benchmarking analysis of existing models of Ancient Greek. Results show that our models provide significant improvements over the SoTA. The systematic analysis of model types can inform future research in designing language models for Classical languages, including the development of novel generative tasks. We make all our models available as community resources, along with a large curated pre-training corpus for Ancient Greek, to support the creation of a larger, comparable model zoo for Classical Philology.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, publisher={Association for Computational Linguistics}, author={Riemenschneider, Frederick and Frank, Anette}, year={2023}, month=jul, pages={15181–15199} }

	abstract = {Trismegistos (TM) is a KU Leuven coordinated metadata platform for the study of texts from the Ancient World. This article provides a survey of its development, from the roots in a prosopography of Ptolemaic Egypt to an all-encompassing database with information about texts from Egypt for the period from 800 BC to AD 800. The current technical setup is detailed in a next section, with special attention for the structure of the many interconnected relational databases. A final section presents the current expansion to include material from outside Egypt, particularly Latin (and to some extent also Greek) inscriptions, in the framework of the CIP-Europeana EAGLE project. It also discusses some potential technological innovations to facilitate data exchange in a linked Open Data environment.},
