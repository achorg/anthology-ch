	abstract = {Recent advances in NLP have led to the creation of powerful language models for many languages including Ancient Greek and Latin. While prior work on Classical languages unanimously uses BERT, in this work we create four language models for Ancient Greek that vary along two dimensions to study their versatility for tasks of interest for Classical languages: we explore (i) encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures using RoBERTa and T5 as strong model types, and create for each of them (ii) a monolingual Ancient Greek and a multilingual instance that includes Latin and English. We evaluate all models on morphological and syntactic tasks, including lemmatization, which demonstrates the added value of T5's decoding abilities. We further define two probing tasks to investigate the knowledge acquired by models pre-trained on Classical texts. Our experiments provide the first benchmarking analysis of existing models of Ancient Greek. Results show that our models provide significant improvements over the SoTA. The systematic analysis of model types can inform future research in designing language models for Classical languages, including the development of novel generative tasks. We make all our models available as community resources, along with a large curated pre-training corpus for Ancient Greek, to support the creation of a larger, comparable model zoo for Classical Philology. Our models and resources are available at https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/ancient-language-models.},

Many epigraphists in the last 20 years have been investigating how to use digital technology to advance their research, but until the present decade, these undertakings were restrained by aspects of the technology. The late 1990s will be seen as a watershed moment in the transition from print-based to born-digital epigraphic publication. At present, the majority of new editions are still published solely in print, but by 2017 we believe this circumstance will change drastically. The history of epigraphy makes it quite clear that such transitions are natural to the discipline.",

With a focus on the inscriptions of first century Pompeii, we stress that graffiti are epigraphic artefacts, thus requiring both epigraphic and archaeological consideration. We present a historical overview explaining how graffiti have been documented, from early publications in the nineteenth century to technological innovations in the twenty-first. We then discuss the aims, methods and results of the Ancient Graffiti Project, a current project to document graffiti and a publicfacing scholarly resource. Based on a decade of epigraphic research and archaeological fieldwork, AGP offers a digital platform and tools to support a richer understanding of ancient graffiti from the early Roman Empire in their archaeological context.},

Despite advancements in latent semantic analysis (LSA) and deep learning, achieving comprehensive semantic understanding and accurate retrieval remains challenging due to high dimensionality and semantic gaps. The above challenges call for new techniques to effectively reduce the dimensions and close the semantic gaps. To this end, we propose VectorSearch, which leverages advanced algorithms, embeddings, and indexing techniques for refined retrieval. By utilizing innovative multi-vector search operations and encoding searches with advanced language models, our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets show that VectorSearch outperforms baseline metrics, demonstrating its efficacy for large-scale retrieval tasks.}, note={arXiv:2409.17383 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2409.17383}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Monir, Solmaz Seyed and Lau, Irene and Yang, Shubing and Zhao, Dongfang}, year={2024}, month=sep }

	abstract = {The application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles can revolutionise the epigraphic discipline by facilitating quantitative and reproducible research. Despite the richness of Latin inscriptions, the lack of low-barrier tools for accessing and analysing these datasets has hindered largescale studies and the uptake of FAIR and Open Science principles in ancient studies. The LatEpig v2.0 tool addresses this gap by enabling researchers to programmatically access the Epigraphic Database Clauss-Slaby, and generate reproducible research following state-of-the-art standards. The main aim of LatEpig is to democratise data access and enhance research potential without requiring advanced technical skills. A case study on ‘viator’ inscriptions exemplifies the tool’s utility, illustrating spatial and temporal trends in inscriptions addressing messengers and travellers across the Roman Empire. LatEpig exemplifies that the development of similar tools is crucial for advancing FAIR and Open Science practices in the Humanities, ensuring that substantial investments in digital resources are fully realised.},

We investigate the fusion of dense semantic, sparse lexical, and graph-based embeddings, focusing on the performance of the MiniLM-v6 and BGE-Large architectures. Contrary to conventional assumptions, our results show that the compact MiniLM-v6 outperforms the larger BGE-Large when integrated with LLM-based re-ranking within our tri-modal hybrid framework. Experiments conducted on the SciFact, FIQA, and NFCorpus datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval quality with the MiniLM-v6 configuration. The performance difference is particularly pronounced in agentic re-ranking scenarios, indicating better alignment between MiniLM-v6's embedding space and LLM reasoning. Our findings suggest that embedding model selection for RAG systems should prioritize compatibility with multi-signal fusion and LLM alignment, rather than relying solely on larger models. This approach may reduce computational requirements while improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency.},
