	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0232083},
	abstract = {The idea that simple visual elements such as colors and lines have specific, universal associations—for example red being warm—appears rather intuitive. Such associations have formed a basis for the description of artworks since the 18th century and are still fundamental to discourses on art today. Art historians might describe a painting where red is dominant as “warm,” “aggressive,” or “lively,” with the tacit assumption that beholders would universally associate the works’ certain key forms with specific qualities, or “aesthetic effects”. However, is this actually the case? Do we actually share similar responses to the same line or color? In this paper, we tested whether and to what extent this assumption of universality (sharing of perceived qualities) is justified. We employed—for the first time—abstract artworks as well as single elements (lines and colors) extracted from these artworks in an experiment in which participants rated the stimuli on 14 “aesthetic effect” scales derived from art literature and empirical aesthetics. To test the validity of the assumption of universality, we examined on which of the dimensions there was agreement, and investigated the influence of art expertise, comparing art historians with lay people. In one study and its replication, we found significantly lower agreement than expected. For the whole artworks, participants agreed on the effects of warm-cold, heavy-light, and happy-sad, but not on 11 other dimensions. Further, we found that the image type (artwork or its constituting elements) was a major factor influencing agreement; people agreed more on the whole artwork than on single elements. Art expertise did not play a significant role and agreement was especially low on dimensions usually of interest in empirical aesthetics (e.g., like-dislike). Our results challenge the practice of interpreting artworks based on their aesthetic effects, as these effects may not be as universal as previously thought.},

To address this problem, we generalize the notion ofprobing tasks to the visual-semantic case. To this end, we (i) discuss the formalization of probing tasks for embeddings of image-caption pairs, (ii) define three concrete probing tasks within our general framework, (iii) train classifiers to probe for those properties, and (iv) compare various state-of-the-art embeddings under the lens of the proposed probing tasks. Our experiments reveal an up to 16{\%} increase in accuracy on visual-semantic embeddings compared to the corresponding unimodal embeddings, which suggest that the text and image dimensions represented in the former do complement each other."

Since most artists were discussed some 400 years ago, by Vasari in the second edition of his Vite and by van Mander in his Schilder-boeck, narratives by art historians can be followed over a long period of time. To explore the dynamic process of canon formation, we collected data on the presence and the greatness of a large number of artists in narrative works written by important art scholars at time intervals of roughly 75 years, so that the 400 years elapsed between 1600 and 2000 are spanned as best as possible. At least half of the artists in the two canons were already there 400 years ago. There are several cases of wrong attributions or of new technical discoveries that prevented some names to be canonical any sooner. There are also artists who art historians learned to appreciate or to understand better, and who entered at much later times. Finally, the number of names that entered or were moved up in the canon because their works acquired new properties in the light of works by artists that followed them is not very large. This appears to be in contradiction with the frequent suggestion that canons are continuously moving and that no artist can survive forever.},

The canonization process is a multifaceted phenomenon, emerging from the intricate interplay of sociological, economic, and political factors. Our objective is to detect the underlying textual dynamics that grant certain works exceptional longevity while jeopardizing the transmission of the majority. Drawing on various criteria, we present an operational framework for defining the French literary canon, centered on its contemporary reception and emphasizing the role of institutions, particularly schools, in its formation. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we unveil an intrinsic norm inherent to the literary canon. Through statistical modeling, we achieve predictive outcomes with accuracy ranging from 70\% to 74\%, contingent on the chosen scale of canonicity. We believe that these findings detect what Charles Altieri calls a “cultural grammar”, referring to the idea that canonical works in literature serve as foundational texts that shape the norms, values, and conventions of a particular cultural tradition. We posit that this linguistic norm arises from biased latent selection mechanisms linked to the role of the educational system in the canon-formation process.},

However, recent work on Danish 19th century literary novels has shown that some non-canonical works shared similar textual qualities with canonical works, underscoring the role of text-extrinsic factors in shaping canonicity. The present study examines the same corpus (more than 800 Danish novels from the Modern Breakthrough era (1870–1900)) to explore socio-economic and institutional factors, as well as demographic features, specifically, book prices, publishers, and the author`s nationality – in determining canonical status. We combine expert-based and national definitions of canon to set up a classification experiment to test the predictive power of these external features, and to understand how they relate to that of text-intrinsic features. We show that the canonization process is influenced by external factors – such as publisher and nationality – but that text-intrinsic features nevertheless maintain predictive power in a dynamic interplay of text and context.},

In this paper we study whether VTs that are pre-trained on the popular ImageNet dataset learn representations that are transferable to the non-natural image domain. To do so we consider three well-studied art classification problems and use them as a surrogate for studying the TL potential of four popular VTs. Their performance is extensively compared against that of four common CNNs across several TL experiments. Our results show that VTs exhibit strong generalization properties and that these networks are more powerful feature extractors than CNNs.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of large digitized fine art collections opens new research perspectives in the intersection of artificial intelligence and art history. Motivated by the successful performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for a wide variety of computer vision tasks, in this paper we explore their applicability for art-related image classification tasks. We perform extensive CNN fine-tuning experiments and consolidate in one place the results for five different art-related classification tasks on three large fine art datasets. Along with addressing the previously explored tasks of artist, genre, style and time period classification, we introduce a novel task of classifying artworks based on their association with a specific national artistic context. We present state-of-the-art classification results of the addressed tasks, signifying the impact of our method on computational analysis of art, as well as other image classification related research areas. Furthermore, in order to question transferability of deep representations across various source and target domains, we systematically compare the effects of domain-specific weight initialization by evaluating networks pre-trained for different tasks, varying from object and scene recognition to sentiment and memorability labelling. We show that fine-tuning networks pre-trained for scene recognition and sentiment prediction yields better results than fine-tuning networks pre-trained for object recognition. This novel outcome of our work suggests that the semantic correlation between different domains could be inherent in the CNN weights. Additionally, we address the practical applicability of our results by analysing different aspects of image similarity. We show that features derived from fine-tuned networks can be employed to retrieve images similar in either style or content, which can be used to enhance capabilities of search systems in different online art collections.},

	doi = {10.3389/frai.2022.976235},
	abstract = {Most Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) methods use a pretrained ImageNet classification model as a base to fine-tune. We hypothesize that content classification is not an optimal pretraining task for IAA, since the task discourages the extraction of features that are useful for IAA, e.g., composition, lighting, or style. On the other hand, we argue that the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model is a better base for IAA models, since it has been trained using natural language supervision. Due to the rich nature of language, CLIP needs to learn a broad range of image features that correlate with sentences describing the image content, composition, environments, and even subjective feelings about the image. While it has been shown that CLIP extracts features useful for content classification tasks, its suitability for tasks that require the extraction of style-based features like IAA has not yet been shown. We test our hypothesis by conducting a three-step study, investigating the usefulness of features extracted by CLIP compared to features obtained from the last layer of a comparable ImageNet classification model. In each step, we get more computationally expensive. First, we engineer natural language prompts that let CLIP assess an image's aesthetic without adjusting any weights in the model. To overcome the challenge that CLIP's prompting only is applicable to classification tasks, we propose a simple but effective strategy to convert multiple prompts to a continuous scalar as required when predicting an image's mean aesthetic score. Second, we train a linear regression on the AVA dataset using image features obtained by CLIP's image encoder. The resulting model outperforms a linear regression trained on features from an ImageNet classification model. It also shows competitive performance with fully fine-tuned networks based on ImageNet, while only training a single layer. Finally, by fine-tuning CLIP's image encoder on the AVA dataset, we show that CLIP only needs a fraction of training epochs to converge, while also performing better than a fine-tuned ImageNet model. Overall, our experiments suggest that CLIP is better suited as a base model for IAA methods than ImageNet pretrained networks.},

	abstract = {Deep pre-trained vision models provide automated ways of analyzing large digitized corpora of visual art. Central to the success of these models is their ability to extract rich embeddings for downstream tasks such as style classification or painting retrieval. Recent results suggest that multimodal models trained on a combination of visual and linguistic input yield semantically enhanced and higher-quality representations of images compared to unimodal vision models. While these multimodal models seem extremely promising for the computational study of visual art, where semantic knowledge might be relevant to produce informative representations of artworks, research benchmarking multimodal models for feature extraction in the art domain is limited, and their potential for representing visual art remains to be explored. This paper aims to fill this gap, and it compares the representational abilities of seven uni-modal and multimodal state-of-the-art pre-trained vision models by employing their embeddings in three domain-specific downstream tasks: genre classification, style classification, and artist classification in the WikiArt dataset. Results reveal that multimodal models perform best as feature extractors for artworks as opposed to unimodal models. We hypothesize that pre-training on natural language descriptions provides multimodal models with enhanced abilities to infer global semantic representations of an image, which is beneficial to identifying key characteristics of artworks such as their genre, author, and style.},

With an updated plain Transformer architecture as well as extensive pre-training from an open \& accessible giant CLIP vision encoder, EVA-02 demonstrates superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches across various representative vision tasks, while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and compute budgets. Notably, using exclusively publicly accessible training data, EVA-02 with only 304 M parameters achieves a phenomenal 90.0 fine-tuning top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1 K val set. Additionally, our EVA-02-CLIP can reach up to 80.4 zero-shot top-1 on ImageNet-1 K, outperforming the previous largest \& best open-sourced CLIP with only ∼1/6 parameters and ∼ 1/6 image-text training data. We offer four EVA-02 variants in various model sizes, ranging from 6 M to 304 M parameters, all with impressive performance. To facilitate open access and open research, we release the complete suite of EVA-02 to the community at https://github.com/baaivision/EVA/tree/master/EVA-02.},

Vi forbinder ofte det danske landskab med grønne bøge, kyststrækninger, bølgende kornmarker og monumenter fra ældre tider.
