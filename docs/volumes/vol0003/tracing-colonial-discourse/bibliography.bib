abstract = "The Netherlands{\textquoteright} most important tradition, the celebration of the feast of Saint Nicholas, (Sinterklaas) has become subject to nation-wide contestation. As Dutch society has become more multicultural, partly due to the immigration from the former Dutch colonies in the West-Indies, new sensitivities have arisen about this institutionalised heritage practice. At the core of the controversy is the figure of Black Pete (Zwarte Piet), Saint Nicholas{\textquoteright} black-faced companion. Some communities within Dutch society perceive this figure as highly menacing and insulting. To the majority of the population, however, Zwarte Piet is an essential part of its heritage and identity. The ensuing controversy can be understood as a matter of heritage narratives conflicting. These narratives do not just give meaning to the tradition, but are also instrumentalized by actors in the debate to achieve their goals. They are used to justify or reject the appearance of Zwarte Piet, and to critically debate Dutch identity. In this article we reconstruct the Zwarte Piet narratives, and explain why these are so incommensurable. Naturally, we also pay attention to what is at stake for the activists on all sides.",

In this work, we explore the semantic shift of the Dutch words ``natie'' ({``}nation''), ``volk'' ({``}people'') and ``vaderland'' ({``}fatherland'') over a period that is known for the rise of nationalism in Europe: 1700-1880. The semantic change is measured by means of Dynamic Bernoulli Word Embeddings which allow for comparison between word embeddings over different time slices. The word embeddings were generated based on Dutch fiction literature divided over different decades. From the analysis of the absolute drifts, it appears that the word ``natie'' underwent a relatively small drift. However, the drifts of ``vaderland''' and ``volk''' show multiple peaks, culminating around the turn of the nineteenth century. To verify whether this semantic change can indeed be attributed to nationalistic movements, a detailed analysis of the nearest neighbours of the target words is provided. From the analysis, it appears that ``natie'', ``volk'' and ``vaderlan''' became more nationalistically-loaded over time."

This paper specifically examines bias related to gender in six Dutch national newspapers between 1950 and 1990. We measure bias related to gender by comparing local changes in word embedding models trained on newspapers with divergent ideological backgrounds. We demonstrate clear differences in gender bias and changes within and between newspapers over time. In relation to themes such as sexuality and leisure, we see the bias moving toward women, whereas, generally, the bias shifts in the direction of men, despite growing female employment number and feminist movements. Even though Dutch society became less stratified ideologically (depillarization), we found an increasing divergence in gender bias between religious and social-democratic on the one hand and liberal newspapers on the other. Methodologically, this paper illustrates how word embeddings can be used to examine historical language change. Future work will investigate how fine-tuning deep contextualized embedding models, such as ELMO, might be used for similar tasks with greater contextual information."

We describe the contents of the corpus by analysing inter-rater agreement and differences between experts and crowd workers. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of the corpus for automated detection of contentiousness. We show that a simple classifier applied to the embedding representation of a target word provides a better than baseline performance in predicting contentiousness. We find that the term itself and the context play a role in whether a term is considered contentious.},

abstract = "Title: 'Imperialism and Morality: Indonesia, Suriname, the Caribbean, the Netherlands and the Colonial Administration of A.W.F. Idenburg, 1901-1935' In Dutch colonial historiography, the period from 1901 to World War II is known as the era of the Dutch ethical imperialism. It was a period where the Netherlands, like other European colonial powers, attempted to present its colonial policy as a social and economic emancipation programme. This meant that the Netherlands wanted to pursue economic growth, social emancipation, and cultural elevation in its colonies of the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia), Suriname, and the islands in the Dutch Caribbean. While this ethical imperialist thinking had emerged in the nineteenth century, it was not until 1901 that it was turned into policy by the government of Abraham Kuyper (The Kuyper Cabinet, 1901-1905). One member of this government, Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg (1861-1935) would come to embody the Dutch ethical colonial policy. Despite having served as the minister for Colonial Affairs in three cabinets and held the positions of Governor-General of Suriname and Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, and therefore being a highly influential figure in Dutch colonial policy, Idenburg{\textquoteright}s policy has never been analysed systematically in the historiography of Dutch imperialism. This is a gap that this doctoral thesis aims to fill. This doctoral thesis revolves around the question of how the Netherlands, and Idenburg in particular, was able to pursue a policy of ethical imperialism against a backdrop of changing colonial relations and geopolitical developments. To what extent was Idenburg able to play a decisive role in the Dutch colonial policy? It is divided into three parts that are in line with the angles worked out by the nineteenth-century French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville in his liberal-conservative world view, (and as interpreted by the Dutch Anti-Revolutionary leaders G. Groen van Prinsterer and Abraham Kuyper): social imperialism, culture and identity politics, and the workings of democracy. The three parts are: I: Civilisation and Conflict; II: Identity and Nation-building; III: Representation and Revolution. The main conclusion of this study is that the dialectical approach to ethical policy as shaped by Idenburg accelerated the emancipation and decolonisation of the Dutch colonial empire. By adopting Idenburg{\textquoteright}s policy, the Netherlands (unknowingly) created ideal conditions for the independence of Indonesia and Suriname that would be proclaimed much later. Idenburg turned out to be unable to make the ethical element prevail over the power politics element of ethical imperialism. The ambivalence of ethical imperialism – a complex paradox for many historians - can be explained by the Tocquevilian liberal-conservative interpretation of Idenburg{\textquoteright}s ethical policy. In his policy Idenburg was seeking for freedom of religion, cultural diversity and pluralism; at the same time, he highlighted the uniqueness and strength of his own European-Christian culture. On the one hand Idenburg feared political disruptions that developed towards a revolution, and at the same time Idenburg was actively committed to pursuit more democracy for the Indonesian people and persisted in the support of the social and political emancipation of the population, even if this resulted in an independent Indonesia or Suriname.",

This study investigates the usage of ``slave'' and ``servant'' in 19th century US newspapers using computational methods. While both terms were used to refer to enslaved African Americans, they were used in distinct ways. In the Chronicling America corpus, we included possible OCR errors by using FastText embedding and excluded text reprints to consider text reprint culture in the 19th century. Word2vec embedding was used to find semantically close words to ``slave'' and ``servant'' and log-odds ratio was calculated to identify over-represented discourse words in the Southern and Northern newspapers. We found that ``slave'' is associated with socio-economic, legal, and administrative words, however, ``servant'' is linked to religious words in the Northern newspapers while Southern newspapers associated ``servant'' with domestic and familial words. We further found that slave discourse words in Southern newspapers are more prevalent in Northern newspapers while servant discourse words from each side are prevalent in their own region. This study contributes to the understanding of how newspapers created different discourses around enslaved African Americans in the 19th century US."

    abstract = "Recent years have witnessed a surge of publications aimed at tracing temporal changes in lexical semantics using distributional methods, particularly prediction-based word embedding models. However, this vein of research lacks the cohesion, common terminology and shared practices of more established areas of natural language processing. In this paper, we survey the current state of academic research related to diachronic word embeddings and semantic shifts detection. We start with discussing the notion of semantic shifts, and then continue with an overview of the existing methods for tracing such time-related shifts with word embedding models. We propose several axes along which these methods can be compared, and outline the main challenges before this emerging subfield of NLP, as well as prospects and possible applications."
