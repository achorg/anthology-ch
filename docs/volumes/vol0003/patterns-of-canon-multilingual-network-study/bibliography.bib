	abstract = {In this study, we employ a classification approach to show that different categories of literary "quality" display unique linguistic profiles, leveraging a corpus that encompasses titles from the Norton Anthology, Penguin Classics series, and the Open Syllabus project, contrasted against contemporary bestsellers, Nobel prize winners and recipients of prestigious literary awards. Our analysis reveals that canonical and so called high-brow texts exhibit distinct textual features when compared to other quality categories such as bestsellers and popular titles as well as to control groups, likely responding to distinct (but not mutually exclusive) models of quality. We apply a classic machine learning approach, namely Random Forest, to distinguish quality novels from "control groups", achieving up to 77{\textbackslash}\% F1 scores in differentiating between the categories. We find that quality category tend to be easier to distinguish from control groups than from other quality categories, suggesting than literary quality features might be distinguishable but shared through quality proxies.},

In arguing the 'truth' and 'method' acted in opposition to each other, Gadamer examined the ways in which historical and cultural circumstance fundamentally influenced human understanding.

Their judgments of the same novels were compared with the results of computational analysis of the books.

We evaluate whether canonical novels introduced a significant textual novelty in their time, and explore their influence on the overall literary trend of the period. By analyzing the positions of canonical versus non-canonical novels in semantic space, we seek to better understand the link between a novel's canonical status and its literary impact. Additionally, we examine the overall diversification of Modern Breakthrough novels during this significant period of rising literary readership. We find that canonical novels stand out from both the historical novel genre and non-canonical novels of the period. Our findings on diversification within and across groups indicate that the novels now regarded as canonical served as literary trendsetters of their time.},

Following Tynianov’s understanding of literature, we adopt a dynamic approach to literature by proposing a model of literary variability using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We retrieve key authors and works that shape the broad outlines of literary change. Our aim is to evaluate the importance of canonical authors on literary variability. We opt for a cohort-driven setup to analyze the variability contributed by a given text, focusing on specific formal and semantic aspects of texts such as topics, lexicon, characterization, and chronotope.

	title = {Latent Structures of Intertextuality in French Fiction},

	abstract = {Intertextuality is a key concept in literary theory that challenges traditional notions of text, signification or authorship. It views texts as part of a vast intertextual network that is constantly evolving and being reconfigured. This paper argues that the field of computational literary studies is the ideal place to conduct a study of intertextuality since we have now the ability to systematically compare texts with each others. Specifically, we present a work on a corpus of more than 12.000 French fictions from the 18th, 19th and early 20th century. We focus on evaluating the underlying roles of two literary notions, sub-genres and the literary canon in the framing of textuality. The article attempts to operationalize intertextuality using state-of-the-art contextual language models to encode novels and capture features that go beyond simple lexical or thematic approaches. Previous research (Hughes, 2012) supports the existence of a literary "style of a time", and our findings further reinforce this concept. Our findings also suggest that both subgenres and canonicity play a significant role in shaping textual similarities within French fiction. These discoveries point to the importance of considering genre and canon as dynamic forces that influence the evolution and intertextual connections of literary works within specific historical contexts.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the scheming slave (servus callidus), a characteristic type of Roman comedy, using digital methods. I carried out network analyses of 23 Roman comedies using the {DraCor} infrastructure and found data trends that shape a data profile of the character type of the servus callidus. This type shows a significant centralisation in the dramatic network, with having a high degree centrality, a high weighted degree centrality, a high closeness centrality, and a high betweenness centrality. While this character has many relationships, shown by a high degree centrality and a large number of triangles, it has a low clustering coefficient. This profile can be sharpened by using count-based measures, namely the number of words spoken by the scheming slave, the number of his speech acts as well as the number of scenes in which he appears. All these count-based values are significantly high for the scheming slave. By combining network measures and count-based measures, I have created a data profile of the scheming slave in Roman comedy. I was also able to show that this profile is typical of both male and female scheming slaves as it does not regularly apply to other scheming character types.},

The main problem lies in the fact that there should be no influence at all in the results of the formula of the length of the text in terms of the number of words it contains. Therefore, different indices have been designed, which are increasingly complex and sophisticated. This work is a review of the most important indices for calculating lexical richness, in order of complexity, looking into whether or not they are dependent on text length and a comparative analysis of the results of the different indices for different text types is presented.},
