	abstract = {Art therapy theory assumes that art work is related to differential constructs of the artist. Empirically, this hypothesis has not been established because findings based on quantitative methods are rare. The Rating Instrument for two-dimensional Pictorial Work (RizbA) is designed to address this issue. The construct − pictorial expression − is theoretically defined by seven content areas: representation, color, shape, space, motion, composition, expression. In combination these create the overall test construct. The test development is based on art historical and art therapeutic theories, and the findings are supported empirically. Two online studies were conducted using a sample of nine pictures. These were rated by experts (n1=12, n2=8). In the first study, based on psychometric characteristics, an item pool of 113 items was examined and a preliminary test version developed. The second study examined quality criteria of the preliminary version. For both studies, factor analyses were computed. The preliminary version includes 26 items. Its ability for differentiation between pictorial works ranges between .897 (T1) and .766 (T2), its inter-rater reliability between .525 (T1) and .917 (T2). Test-retest reliability is .919. PCA suggests a four-factors solution, which in large part is consistent across studies. As a reliable measurement RizbA opens new perspectives in fundamental art therapeutic and psychological research.},

This progress can also benefit art psychology by facilitating data collection on artworks without the need to recruit experts as raters. In this study a machine learning approach is used to predict the ratings of RizbA, a Rating instrument for two-dimensional pictorial works. Based on a pre-trained model, the algorithm was fine-tuned via transfer learning on 886 pictorial works by contemporary professional artists and non-professionals. As quality criterion, artificial intelligence raters (ART) are compared with generic raters (GR) created from the real human expert raters, using error rate and mean squared error (MSE). ART ratings have been found to have the same error range as randomly chosen human ratings. Therefore, they can be seen as equivalent to real human expert raters for almost all items in RizbA. Further training with more data will close the gap to the human raters on all items.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

	doi = {10.3389/frai.2022.976235},
	abstract = {Most Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) methods use a pretrained ImageNet classification model as a base to fine-tune. We hypothesize that content classification is not an optimal pretraining task for IAA, since the task discourages the extraction of features that are useful for IAA, e.g. composition, lighting, or style. On the other hand, we argue that the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model is a better base for IAA models, since it has been trained using natural language supervision. Due to the rich nature of language, CLIP needs to learn a broad range of image features that correlate with sentences describing the image content, composition, environments, and even subjective feelings about the image. While it has been shown that CLIP extracts features useful for content classification tasks, its suitability for tasks that require the extraction of style-based features like IAA has not yet been shown. We test our hypothesis by conducting a three-step study, investigating the usefulness of features extracted by CLIP compared to features obtained from the last layer of a comparable ImageNet classification model. In each step, we get more computationally expensive. First, we engineer natural language prompts that let CLIP assess an image's aesthetic without adjusting any weights in the model. To overcome the challenge that CLIP's prompting only is applicable to classification tasks, we propose a simple but effective strategy to convert multiple prompts to a continuous scalar as required when predicting an image's mean aesthetic score. Second, we train a linear regression on the AVA dataset using image features obtained by CLIP's image encoder. The resulting model outperforms a linear regression trained on features from an ImageNet classification model. It also shows competitive performance with fully fine-tuned networks based on ImageNet, while only training a single layer. Finally, by fine-tuning CLIP's image encoder on the AVA dataset, we show that CLIP only needs a fraction of training epochs to converge, while also performing better than a fine-tuned ImageNet model. Overall, our experiments suggest that CLIP is better suited as a base model for IAA methods than ImageNet pretrained networks.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12906-023-04258-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer-related psychological and physical disorders can mean stressful and painful experiences for patients. Art therapy, a form of complementary and alternative medicine, is an increasingly popular way to decrease emotional stress, alleviate somatic symptoms, and improve quality of life in patients with cancer. However, current systematic reviews have not explored the beneficial effects of art therapy. Moreover, there have been inconsistent findings on the effect of this therapy, and there is insufficient evidence to confirm the effects in adults with cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of art therapy in improving quality of life and psychosomatic symptoms in adults with cancer.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis included adults with all kinds of cancer. Six English-language and three large Chinese-language databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies. Gray literature and references were also checked. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool.
RESULTS: Eight eligible randomized controlled trials conducted in four countries were included. Art therapy improved overall quality of life, but had no significant effect on psychological health or physical health sub-dimensions in women with cancer. Moreover, art therapy alleviated anxiety and depression, but had only a tendency toward an effect on somatic symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality evidence shows that art therapy is beneficial for women with cancer in terms of improving the overall quality of life and alleviating emotional symptoms (anxiety and depression). However, more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy of this therapy on somatic symptoms.},

However, the integration of novel technologies, such as AI-generated art, brings along ethical, psychological, and technical challenges that are viewed differently among therapists. We aim to gauge art therapists’ views on the ethical, application, and challenge facets of utilizing AI-generated art from medical images in therapy. The focus is on assessing its applicability and limitations for melanoma patients. Art therapists were surveyed via a questionnaire focusing on their experience, digital tool familiarity, and views on AI in therapy, encompassing ethics, benefits, challenges, and applicability for melanoma. Art therapists have already implemented digital technologies and acknowledged potential therapeutic benefits of creating personalized artworks with generative artificial intelligence. Attention needs to be given to technological hurdles and the necessity for supplementary interventions. Views on the method’s adaptability varied, underscoring a need for tailored, patient-focused applications. Art therapists are welcoming AI-generated art as a promising creative therapeutic tool and acknowledge potential therapeutic benefits. There are ethical, technical, and psychological challenges that must be addressed for application in therapeutic sessions. Therapists should navigate AI integration with sensitivity, adhering to ethical norms around consent and privacy. Future studies should show the therapeutic benefit in practice with emphasis on equipping therapists to manage the technical complexities effectively. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that patients can influence the AI output, allowing for creative moments in the process.},

Opportunities that digital technology potentially creates for art therapy reach beyond increased access to include new possibilities of adaptation and extension of therapy tool box. Given growing interest in practice and research in this area, it is important to investigate how art therapists engage with digital technology or how (and whether) practice might be safely adapted to include new potential modes of delivery and new arts media.MethodsAn integrative review of peer-reviewed literature on the use of digital technology in art therapy was conducted. The methodology used is particularly well suited for early stage exploratory inquiries, allowing for close examination of papers from a variety of methodological paradigms. Both quantitative and qualitative research was synthesised. Only studies that presented empirical outcomes were included in the formal analysis.FindingsOver 400 records were screened and 13 papers were included in the synthesis, pertaining to both the use of digital technology for remote delivery and as a medium for art making. Recurring themes are discussed, including potential benefits and risks of incorporating digital technology in sessions with clients, concerns relating to ethics, resistance towards digital arts media, technological limitations and implications for therapeutic relationship and therapy process. Propositions for best practice and technological innovations that could make some of the challenges redundant are also reviewed. Future directions in research are indicated and cautious openness is recommended in both research and practice.ConclusionsThe review documents growing research illustrating increased use of digital technology by art therapists for both online delivery and digital art making. Potentially immense opportunities that technology brings for art therapy should be considered alongside limitations and challenges of clinical, pragmatic and ethical nature. The review aims to invite conversations and further research to explore ways in which technology could increase relevance and reach of art therapy without compromising clients’ safety and key principles of the profession.},

While research on the use of conversational and embodied AI in psychotherapy practice is developing rapidly, it leaves gaps in understanding of the impact that creative AI might have on art psychotherapy practice specifically. A constructive dialogue between the disciplines of creative AI and art psychotherapy is needed, to establish potential relevance of AI-bases technologies to therapeutic practice involving artmaking and creative self-expression.MethodsThis integrative review set out to explore whether and how creative AI could enhance the practice of art psychotherapy and other psychological interventions utilizing visual communication and/or artmaking. A transdisciplinary search strategy was developed to capture the latest research across diverse methodologies and stages of development, including reviews, opinion papers, prototype development and empirical research studies.FindingsOf over 550 records screened, 10 papers were included in this review. Their key characteristics are mapped out on a matrix of stakeholder groups involved, elements of interventions belonging to art therapy domain, and the types of AI-based technologies involved. Themes of key significance for AT practice are discussed, including cultural adaptability, inclusivity and accessibility, impact on creativity and self-expression, and unpredictability and imperfection. A positioning diagram is proposed to describe the role of AI in AT. AI’s role in the therapy process oscillates on a spectrum from being a partner in the co-creative process to taking the role of a curator of personalized visuals with therapeutic intent. Another dimension indicates the level of autonomy – from a supportive tool to an autonomous agent. Examples for each of these situations are identified in the reviewed literature.ConclusionWhile creative AI brings opportunities for new modes of self-expression and extended reach of art therapy, over-reliance on it presents risks to the therapy process, including of loss of agency for clients and therapists. Implications of AI-based technology on therapeutic relationship in psychotherapy demand further investigation, as do its cultural and psychological impacts, before the relevance of creative AI to art therapy practice can be confirmed.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Art therapy, as a non-pharmacological medical complementary and alternative therapy, has been used as one of medical interventions with good clinical effects on mental disorders. However, systematically reviewed in detail in clinical situations is lacking. Here, we searched on PubMed for art therapy in an attempt to explore its theoretical basis, clinical applications, and future perspectives to summary its global pictures. Since drawings and paintings have been historically recognized as a useful part of therapeutic processes in art therapy, we focused on studies of art therapy which mainly includes painting and drawing as media. As a result, a total of 413 literature were identified. After carefully reading full articles, we found that art therapy has been gradually and successfully used for patients with mental disorders with positive outcomes, mainly reducing suffering from mental symptoms. These disorders mainly include depression disorders and anxiety, cognitive impairment and dementias, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and autism. These findings suggest that art therapy can not only be served as an useful therapeutic method to assist patients to open up and share their feelings, views, and experiences, but also as an auxiliary treatment for diagnosing diseases to help medical specialists obtain complementary information different from conventional tests. We humbly believe that art therapy has great potential in clinical applications on mental disorders to be further explored.},

	abstract = {This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of an assessor-blind, randomised controlled trial of psychodynamic art therapy for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, and to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of this intervention during acute psychotic episodes. Fifty-eight inpatients with DSM-diagnoses of schizophrenia were randomised to either 12 twice-weekly sessions of psychodynamic group art therapy plus treatment as usual or to standard treatment alone. Primary outcome criteria were positive and negative psychotic and depressive symptoms as well as global assessment of functioning. Secondary outcomes were mentalising function, estimated with the Reading the mind in the eyes test and the Levels of emotional awareness scale, self-efficacy, locus of control, quality of life and satisfaction with care. Assessments were made at baseline, at post-treatment and at 12 weeks' follow-up. At 12 weeks, 55\% of patients randomised to art therapy, and 66\% of patients receiving treatment as usual were examined. In the per-protocol sample, art therapy was associated with a significantly greater mean reduction of positive symptoms and improved psychosocial functioning at post-treatment and follow-up, and with a greater mean reduction of negative symptoms at follow-up compared to standard treatment. The significant reduction of positive symptoms at post-treatment was maintained in an attempted intention-to-treat analysis. There were no group differences regarding depressive symptoms. Of secondary outcome parameters, patients in the art therapy group showed a significant improvement in levels of emotional awareness, and particularly in their ability to reflect about others' emotional mental states. This is one of the first randomised controlled trials on psychodynamic group art therapy for patients with acute psychotic episodes receiving hospital treatment. Results prove the feasibility of trials on art therapy during acute psychotic episodes and justify further research to substantiate preliminary positive results regarding symptom reduction and the recovery of mentalising function.

While preventing PICS among ICU patients is becoming increasingly important, interventions remain limited. Building on evidence supporting the effectiveness of art exposure in addressing the psychological aspects of PICS, we propose a novel art therapy solution through a collaborative Human-AI approach that enhances personalized therapeutic interventions using state-of-the-art Visual Art Recommendation Systems. We developed two Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) personalization methods and assessed their impact through a large-scale user study (N = 150). Our findings demonstrate that this Human-AI collaboration not only enhances the personalization and effectiveness of art therapy but also supports therapists by streamlining their workload. While our study centres on PICS intervention, the results suggest that human-AI collaborative Art therapy could potentially benefit other areas where emotional support is critical, such as cases of anxiety and depression.},

However, the potential of digital technologies has not been fully leveraged; especially, applying AI technologies in digital art therapy is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose an AI-infused art-making system, DeepThInk, to investigate the potential of introducing a human-AI co-creative process into art therapy, by collaborating with five experienced registered art therapists over ten months. DeepThInk offers a range of tools which can lower the expertise threshold for art-making while improving users’ creativity and expressivity. We gathered the insights of DeepThInk through expert reviews and a two-part user evaluation with both synchronous and asynchronous therapy setups. This longitudinal iterative design process helped us derive and contextualize design principles of human-AI co-creation for art therapy, shedding light on future design in relevant domains.},

Moreover, art therapy might help to recover mentalizing function in psychosis by stimulating the formation of mental representations of thoughts and feelings, to develop a "language" for the mental processes of oneself and others and to understand mental states by the ascription of meaning. The research project was planned as a pilot study with two main objectives. These are evaluate the feasibility of an efficacy trial of art therapy, delivered in an inpatient setting, for patients with schizophrenia during acute psychotic episodes, and collect preliminary data on the effects of art therapy on psychotic and depressive symptoms.

	abstract = {Art therapy relates to the concepts of the unconscious in many respects – most art therapists presume that particularly the patient’s artwork visualises something of his or her unconscious inner life. Current controversies in psychoanalysis about consciousness and unconscious in the therapeutic relationship can be most valuable for art therapists and reach beyond the scope of the artwork representing the invisible. The new concept of the unconscious distinguishes between the vertical and the horizontal dimension, denoting the mechanism of repression in the psychic processes on the one hand, and the horizontal social resonance space on the other. Successful therapy crucially depends on the horizontal dimension of the unconscious, indicating that therapeutic competencies are closely related to non-conceptuality. Consequently the focus in art therapy is not only on the artwork and its potential unconscious aspects, but it concentrates on the effects of the unconscious in the on-going processes between therapist, patient and artwork. For the art therapist this means to relate in a very special way to the patient as well as to the emerging art and to frame his intervention accordingly. The essay researches the concept of the unconscious from different perspectives and it explores and locates the structures of the complex lines of relationships between therapist, patient and artwork.},
