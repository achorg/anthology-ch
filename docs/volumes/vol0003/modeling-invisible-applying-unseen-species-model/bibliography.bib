Esta mat{\'e}ria narrativa configura-se nas primeiras duas d{\'e}cadas do s{\'e}culo XIII como uma organiza{\c c}{\~a}o c{\'i}clica em prosa designada por Ciclo da Vulgata. Este conjunto c{\'i}clico conhece, entre 1230-1240, uma vers{\~a}o expandida ou condensada, de acordo com diferentes estudiosos que se debru{\c c}aram sobre o problema, designada por Pseudo Robert de Boron. Origin{\'a}rio de solo franc{\^e}s, o romance arturiano conta desde a segunda metade do s{\'e}culo XIII com express{\~o}es transpirena{\'i}cas. A Pen{\'i}nsula Ib{\'e}rica ser{\'a} o primeiro ber{\c c}o das tradu{\c c}{\~o}es da mat{\'e}ria arturiana e os testemunhos preservados atestam tamb{\'e}m vers{\~o}es em tr{\^e}s l{\'i}nguas: galego-portugu{\^e}s, castelhano e catal{\~a}o. Este trabalho prop{\~o}e-se realizar um estudo interdisciplinar dos primeiros testemunhos da tradu{\c c}{\~a}o galego-portuguesa do romance arturiano conservados nos arquivos e nas bibliotecas hisp{\^a}nicas - os fragmentos da Estaria do Santo Graal, do Livro de Merlin e do Livro de Tristan que chegaram at{\'e} n{\'o}s. Para avan{\c c}ar solidamente neste estudo, consider{\'a}mos oportuno a an{\'a}lise pormenorizada da sua materialidade f{\'i}sica e textual. O car{\'a}cter arcaico dos textos arturianos transmitidos nas tradu{\c c}{\~o}es galego-portuguesas tem sido debatido com base em testemunhos tardios (a Demanda portuguesa, o Livro de Jos{\'e} de Arimatei{\`a}), que revelam um substrato de l{\'i}ngua muito antigo (Nunes, 1908, Castro, 1984). Ora, a confirma{\c c}{\~a}o deste pressuposto veio com a descoberta, como veremos, de alguns dos manuscritos liter{\'a}rios mais antigos em galego-portugu{\^e}s, que atestam um estado da l{\'i}ngua liter{\'a}ria muito antigo, configurando-se como os mais antigos testemunhos do ciclo do Pseudo Robert de Boron.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Estimating the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of a community is challenging because rare species are often undetected, even with intensive sampling. The Good-Turing frequency formula, originally developed for cryptography, estimates in an ecological context the true frequencies of rare species in a single assemblage based on an incomplete sample of individuals. Until now, this formula has never been used to estimate undetected species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity. Here, we first generalize the Good-Turing formula to incomplete sampling of two assemblages. The original formula and its two-assemblage generalization provide a novel and unified approach to notation, terminology, and estimation of undetected biological diversity. For species richness, the Good-Turing framework offers an intuitive way to derive the non-parametric estimators of the undetected species richness in a single assemblage, and of the undetected species shared between two assemblages. For phylogenetic diversity, the unified approach leads to an estimator of the undetected Faith's phylogenetic diversity (                                PD                              , the total length of undetected branches of a phylogenetic tree connecting all species), as well as a new estimator of undetected                                PD                              shared between two phylogenetic trees. For functional diversity based on species traits, the unified approach yields a new estimator of undetected Walker et~al.'s functional attribute diversity (                                FAD                              , the total species-pairwise functional distance) in a single assemblage, as well as a new estimator of undetected                                FAD                              shared between two assemblages. Although some of the resulting estimators have been previously published (but derived with traditional mathematical inequalities), all taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity estimators are now derived under the same framework. All the derived estimators are theoretically lower bounds of the corresponding undetected diversities; our approach reveals the sufficient conditions under which the estimators are nearly unbiased, thus offering new insights. Simulation results are reported to numerically verify the performance of the derived estimators. We illustrate all estimators and assess their sampling uncertainty with an empirical dataset for Brazilian rain forest trees. These estimators should be widely applicable to many current problems in ecology, such as the effects of climate change on spatial and temporal beta diversity and the contribution of trait diversity to ecosystem multi-functionality.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            An enormous number of measures based on different criteria have been proposed to quantify evenness or unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage. However, a unified approach that can encompass most of the widely used indices is still lacking. Here, we first present some basic requirements for an evenness measure. We then propose that unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage can be measured by a normalized divergence between the vector of species relative abundances and the mean vector, where the mean vector represents the species relative abundances of a completely even assemblage. Thus, evenness among species relative abundances is measured by the corresponding normalized extent of closeness between these two vectors. We consider five divergence measures, leading to five classes of evenness indices. All our evenness measures are in terms of diversity (Hill number) of order               q~               {$>$}               ~               0 (here               q               controls the weighting of species relative abundances) and species richness (diversity of order               q~               =               ~               0). We propose quantifying evenness through a continuous profile that depicts evenness as a function of diversity order               q~               {$>$}               ~               0. The profiles can be easily and visually compared across multiple assemblages. Our evenness indices satisfy all the requirements presented in this paper and encompass many widely used evenness measures as special cases. When there are multiple assemblages, the abundance-based Jaccard- and S{\o}rensen-type dissimilarity measures (which are monotonic functions of beta diversity) can be expressed as weighted averages of the individual species' compositional unevenness values; here, each individual species' compositional unevenness is calculated based on that species' abundances among assemblages. The contribution of a species to each dissimilarity measure can be clearly disentangled and quantified in terms of this single species' compositional unevenness among assemblages. Thus, our framework links the concepts of evenness, diversity, beta diversity, and similarity. Moreover, the framework can be readily extended to a phylogenetic version. A real data example is used to illustrate our approach. We also discuss some criteria and other measures that were previously proposed in the literature.},

The class of measures is parameterized by an order q {$\geq$} 0 to control for sensitivity to species relative abundances. When q = 0, species abundances are disregarded and our measure reduces to the conventional measure of completeness, that is, the ratio of the observed species richness to the true richness (observed plus undetected). When q = 1, our measure reduces to the sample coverage (the proportion of the total number of individuals in the entire assemblage that belongs to detected species), a concept developed by Alan Turing in his cryptographic analysis. The sample completeness of a general order q {$\geq$} 0 extends Turing's sample coverage and quantifies the proportion of the assemblage's individuals belonging to detected species, with each individual being proportionally weighted by the (q - 1)th power of its abundance. We propose the use of a continuous profile depicting our proposed measures with respect to q {$\geq$} 0 to characterize the sample completeness of a survey. An analytic estimator of the diversity profile and its sampling uncertainty based on a bootstrap method are derived and tested by simulations. To compare diversity across multiple assemblages, we propose an integrated approach based on the framework of Hill numbers to assess (a) the sample completeness profile, (b) asymptotic diversity estimates to infer true diversities of entire assemblages, (c) non-asymptotic standardization via rarefaction and extrapolation, and (d) an evenness profile. Our framework can be extended to incidence data. Empirical data sets from several research fields are used for illustration.},

Simple counts of species richness in samples typically underestimate and strongly depend on sampling effort and sample completeness. There are two approaches to infer species richness and make fair comparisons among multiple assemblages based on possibly unequal sampling effort and incomplete samples that miss many species. (i) An asymptotic approach: this approach compares the estimated asymptotes of species accumulation curves. It is based on statistical sampling-theory methods of estimating species richness. Both parametric and nonparametric methods are reviewed. We focus on the nonparametric estimators that are universally valid for all species abundance distributions. (ii) A nonasymptotic approach: this approach compares the estimated species richnesses of standardized samples with a common finite sample size or sample completeness. It is based on the seamless sample-size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves. This approach aims to compare species richness estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. These two approaches allow researchers to efficiently use all data to make robust and detailed inferences about species richness. Two R packages (SpadeR and iNEXT) are applied to rainforest tree data for illustration.},

But summarizing this complex and multidimensional concept in a single measure is problematic. Dozens of mathematical indices have been proposed for this purpose, but these can provide contradictory results leading to misleading or incorrect conclusions about a community's diversity. In this review, we summarize the key conceptual issues underlying the measurement of ecological diversity, survey the indices most commonly used in ecology, and discuss their relative suitability. We advocate for indices that: (i) satisfy key mathematical axioms; (ii) can be expressed as so-called effective numbers; (iii) can be extended to account for disparity between types; (iv) can be parameterized to obtain diversity profiles; and (v) for which an estimator (preferably unbiased) can be found so that the index is useful for practical applications.},

  abstract = {The study of ancient cultures is hindered by the incomplete survival of material artifacts, so we commonly underestimate the diversity of cultural production in historic societies. To correct this survivorship bias, we applied unseen species models from ecology to gauge the loss of narratives from medieval Europe, such as the romances about King Arthur. The estimates obtained are compatible with the scant historic evidence. In addition to events such as library fires, we identified the original evenness of cultural populations as an overlooked factor in these assemblages' stability in the face of immaterial loss. We link the elevated evenness in island literatures to analogous accounts of ecological and cultural diversity in insular communities. These analyses call for a wider application of these methods across the heritage sciences. , Ecological methods for cultural history Much of the narrative literature from the European Middle Ages has been lost over the ages because of manuscript physical degradation and destruction, including library fires. Kestemont et al . show that established methods from ecology for estimating the numbers of unseen species can be applied to abundance data representing cultural artifacts to estimate the losses that ancient cultural domains have sustained over the centuries. The authors obtain estimates that not only corroborate existing hypotheses from book history, but also reveal unexpected geographic differences that have gone unnoticed so far. For example, insular literatures, such as those from Iceland and Ireland, combine a surprisingly strong cultural persistence with an elevated distributional evenness. ---AMS , Quantitative ecological methods can be used to estimate the extent of losses of medieval narrative literature.},
