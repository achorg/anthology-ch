abstract = {The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition. Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.},

title = "Patterns of Quality: Comparing Reader Reception Across Fanfiction and Commercially Published Literature",
abstract = "Recent work on the textual features linked to literary quality has primarily focused on commercially published literature, such as canonical or best-selling novels, that are systematically filtered by editorial and market mechanisms. However, the biggest repositories of fiction texts currently in existence are free fanfiction websites, where fans post fictional stories about their favorite characters for the pleasure of writing and engaging with others. This makes them a particularly interesting domain to study the patterns of perceived quality “in the wild”, where text-reader relations are less filtered. Moreover, since fanfiction is a community-built domain with its own conventions, comparing it to published literature can more generally provide insights into the reception and perceived quality of published literature itself. Taking a novel approach to the study of fanfiction, we observe whether three textual features associated with perceived literary quality in published texts are also relevant in the context of fanfiction. Using different reception proxies, we find that despite the differences of fanfiction from published literature, some “patterns of quality” associated with positive reception appear to hold similar effects in both of these contexts of literary production.",
