	title = {Latent Structures of Intertextuality in French Fiction},
	rights = {Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International},
	abstract = {Intertextuality is a key concept in literary theory that challenges traditional notions of text, signification or authorship. It views texts as part of a vast intertextual network that is constantly evolving and being reconfigured. This paper argues that the field of computational literary studies is the ideal place to conduct a study of intertextuality since we have now the ability to systematically compare texts with each others. Specifically, we present a work on a corpus of more than 12.000 French fictions from the 18th, 19th and early 20th century. We focus on evaluating the underlying roles of two literary notions, sub-genres and the literary canon in the framing of textuality. The article attempts to operationalize intertextuality using state-of-the-art contextual language models to encode novels and capture features that go beyond simple lexical or thematic approaches. Previous research (Hughes, 2012) supports the existence of a literary "style of a time", and our findings further reinforce this concept. Our findings also suggest that both subgenres and canonicity play a significant role in shaping textual similarities within French fiction. These discoveries point to the importance of considering genre and canon as dynamic forces that influence the evolution and intertextual connections of literary works within specific historical contexts.},

Moving beyond the technical aspects, we explore practical applications of BookNLP-fr with a canonical task for computational literary studies: subgenre classification. We show that BookNLP-fr provides more relevant and -- even more importantly -- more interpretable features to perform automatic subgenre classification than the traditional bag-of-words approach. BookNLP-fr makes NLP techniques available to a larger public and constitutes a new toolkit to process large numbers of digitized books in French. This allows the field to gain a deeper literary understanding through the practice of distant reading.},

Pour quelles raisons lit-on à ce point ce genre de littérature ? Quelles sont les méthodes de Gaston Leroux, Maurice Leblanc, Simenon, Boileau-Narcejac, Frédéric Dard devenu San-Antonio, et celles de quelques autres parmi lesquels Bernanos et Mauriac peuvent être cités ? De 1900 à nos jours, on est passé du roman de pure détection au roman de mœurs criminelles, puis au roman de la victime, enfin au roman de la violence verbale et de la dérision. Ces transformations traduisent l'évolution des mœurs, des croyances, des institutions politiques telle qu'elle est ressentie par une vaste communauté de lecteurs. Lorsque le détective disparaît de la fiction policière et que l'assassin, puis la victime, enfin le lecteur lui-même prennent une place privilégiée dans ces histoires de mort violente, c'est que la société a changé. Étayé par de nombreux exemples, cet ouvrage est aussi une réflexion sur les problèmes techniques qui se sont posés aux meilleurs auteurs « policiers » français en même temps qu'une analyse des multiples implications qu'entraîne la littérature à la fois populaire et savante.},
