The digital project has two basic components: a collection of 1450 full-text cookbooks published in the United States between 1800 and 1920 and a website to present a guide to the collection and the results of the analysis., This article will focus on the workflow for analyzing the metadata and the full-text of the collection. The workflow will cover: 1) creating a searchable public collection of full-text titles within the HathiTrust Digital Library and uploading it to the HTRC Portal, 2) analyzing and visualizing legacy MARC data for the collection using MarcEdit, OpenRefine and Tableau, and 3) using the text analysis tools in the HTRC Portal to look for trends and patterns in the full text of the collection.},

    abstract = {Given the size of digital library collections and the inconsistencies in their genre-related bibliographic metadata, as digital libraries grow and their contents are opened for computational analysis, finding materials of interest becomes a major challenge. This challenge increases for sub-genres and other categories of text data that are less distinct from the whole. This project pilots machine learning methods and word feature analysis for identifying Black Fantastic genre texts within the HathiTrust Digital Library. These texts are sometimes referred to as “Afrofuturism” but more commonly today described as “Black Fantastic,” in which African Diaspora artists and creators engage with the intersections of race and technology in their works with a primary focus on world-building. Black Fantastic texts pose a challenge to genre classification, as they incorporate aspects of science fiction and fantasy with typical characteristics of African Diaspora-produced literature. This paper presents and reports on results from a pilot predictive modeling process to computationally identify Black Fantastic texts using curated word feature sets for each class of data: general English-language fiction, Black-authored fiction, and Black Fantastic fiction.},

    abstract = {This article is motivated by the ‘reproducibility crisis’ that is being discussed intensely in fields such as Psychology or Biology but is also becoming increasingly relevant to Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Digital Humanities, not least in the context of Open Science. Using the phrase ‘repetitive research’ as an umbrella term for a range of practices from replication to follow-up research, and with the objective to provide clarity and help establish best practices in this area, this article focuses on two issues: First, the conceptual space of repetitive research is described across five key dimensions, namely those of the research question or hypothesis, the dataset, the method of analysis, the team, and the results or conclusions. Second, building on this new description of the conceptual space and on earlier terminological work, a specific set of terms for recurring scenarios of repetitive research is proposed. For each scenario, its position in the conceptual space is defined, its typical purpose and added value in the research process are discussed, the requirements for enabling it are described, and illustrative examples from the domain of Computational Literary Studies are provided. The key contribution of this article, therefore, is a proposal for a transparent terminology underpinned by a systematic model of the conceptual space of repetitive research.},
