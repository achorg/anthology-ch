	abstract = {Survey experiments are a core tool for causal inference. Yet, the design of classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how conjoint analysis, an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.},

Female main characters nurtured more than male main characters did, and they were seen in more indoor than outdoor scenes. Occupations were gender stereotyped, and more women than men appeared to have no paid occupation. Few differences were found between Caldecott award books and other books.

However, there is a paucity of research on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant attributes generate support for naturalization with closely corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from the same population and the official descriptions of applicant characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are within 2\% percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.},

Additionally, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was established by Sveriges Riksbank in 1968 and awarded to a "person or persons in the field of economic sciences who have produced work of outstanding importance."
As of 2023, 65 Nobel Prizes and the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded to 64 women. Unique Nobel Prize laureates include 894 men, 64 women, and 27 organizations.
The distribution of Nobel prizes awarded to women is as follows:

nineteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize (16.3\% of 110 awarded);
seventeen have won the Nobel Prize in Literature (14.28\% of 119 awarded);
thirteen have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (5.6\% of 230 awarded);
eight have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (4.1\% of 191 awarded);
five have won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1.8\% of 224 awarded);
and three (Elinor Ostrom, Esther Duflo and Claudia Goldin) have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2.17\% of 92 awarded).
The first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel. Curie is also the first person and the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother–daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes and of Pierre and Irène Curie the only father-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes by the same occasion, whilst there are 6 father-son pairs who have won Nobel Prizes by comparison.
The most Nobel Prizes awarded to women in a single year was in 2009, when five women became laureates in four categories.
The most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Claudia Goldin in Economics, Narges Mohammadi for Peace, Anne L'Huillier in Physics and Katalin Karikó in Physiology or Medicine (2023), Annie Ernaux in Literature and Carolyn R. Bertozzi for Chemistry (2022), Maria Ressa for Peace (2021), Louise Glück in Literature, Andrea M. Ghez in Physics, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A.

Prior research has shown that students’ text-based interest varies significantly between texts. However, it is still unclear why one text elicits greater interest over another. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether different text characteristics, such as text genre, topic, and protagonists’ gender, are systematically related to students’ text-based interest. Furthermore, we examined differences between girls and boys. We used data from a sample of 504 fourth-grade elementary school students to answer these questions. Eight texts were manipulated experimentally with respect to text genre, topic, and protagonists’ gender. Students were assigned randomly to read one of the eight texts. Structural equation models showed that students’ text-based interest was related to text genre, topic, and students’ gender. Moreover, students’ gender interacted significantly with text topic and protagonists’ gender, with boys less interested in texts with a more female-typed text topic and in texts with female protagonists. The findings imply that text characteristics might help educators select reading material to encourage students’ text-based interest. The results are discussed in terms of research and educational practice.},

There were three stories in each of the three types of stories (mystery, adventure, and humor); each of the nine stories appeared in two versions that were identical except for the sex of the main character. Following the reading of the story, the students completed a measure of interest and two comprehension measures (multiple-choice and cloze tests).Students were classified by sex into three levels of reading, and a balanced five-factor (reader-sex, sex-of-protagonist, ability-level, type-of-story, and story [nested within type-of-story]) ANOVA was performed for each dependent measure. A strong sex-of-reader by sex-of-main-character interaction was observed on the interest measure. Boys rated stories much less interesting when the main character was female; girls found stories with male protagonists less interesting, although their preferences were much less pronounced. The interaction was evident at each of three levels of reading ability for each story type. The interest pattern did not translate into comprehension differences. On the comprehension measures, the sex of the main character had no significant effects—girls outscored boys, but this pattern was not significantly influenced by the sex of the protagonist.},

	abstract = {In the present research, we examined the effect of protagonist gender on reader evaluations of excerpts from novels. Extant analyses of the role of gender in reading suggest that there should be a gender-match effect in which, for example, women prefer stories with female protagonists. To test this prediction, we created different versions of the excerpts in which a male protagonist was changed to a female protagonist and vice versa. Readers rated the texts on four evaluation items spanning both personal and intersubjective reactions to both the discourse and the story world. Two samples of readers were used: one in Canada and one in Germany. The results indicated that both men and women rated texts higher on the story-world items when they had a male protagonist, inconsistent with the gender-match prediction. There was no difference in this pattern between Canadian and German readers, suggesting that it is common across these cultures. We provide an alternative account based on the fundamental attribution error.},

While research continues to highlight the apparent systematic underperformance of boys in comparison to girls on national and international reading benchmarks, this text moves beyond broad generalizations to consider complexities inherent in notions of masculinity and associated tensions. Applying a socio-cultural perspective, Scholes highlights the voices of boys and girls by focusing on their reading experiences. Examining the perceived, generalized "crisis" of boys’ underperformance in reading and literacy, Scholes identifies the factors that shape perceptions of masculinity among different groups of boys across the globe.},

	abstract = {Background: Research illustrates that girls indicate more positive attitudes towards reading than boys. Gender differences are often presented in simplistic terms with ‘all boys’ represented as one homogenous group.
Methods: This study developed a survey to identify similarities and differences in boys’ and girls’ attitudes towards a range of school-related activities, including reading, and among boys themselves. The survey of 296 (f = 137, m = 159) 8- to 10-year-olds attending elementary schools in Australia was designed to identify the way attitudes towards school-related activities, including reading, may be interrelated. Cluster analysis identiﬁed nuances associated with socio-economic background, reading frequency and reading outcomes.
Results: Results indicated that girls and boys were represented similarly in the cluster groups that indicated positive enjoyment for books. However, there were signiﬁcantly more girls than boys who enjoyed the social aspects of reading. A main ﬁnding was that many boys indicated they personally enjoyed reading, in contrast to previous studies, however, they did not necessarily enjoy the social aspects of reading with this ﬁnding particularly evident for boys from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Attitude towards reading was interrelated with the social aspects of reading and other school-related activities such as competition sports.
Conclusions: Outcomes from the survey cluster groupings made visible the multiplicity of differences among boys’ attitudes towards reading that are often left out of simplistic representations in educational policies, teaching literature and the popular media. Findings suggest the need to open up educational discussions about the ways that reading attitudes may be embedded within, and related to, socio-economic location and other school-based experiences.},

In general, the findings indicate that the reading behaviour of both parents has a stronger impact on the reading behaviour of daughters. At the same time, the findings support the gender stereotype hypothesis, indicating that fathers have a stronger impact on the reading behaviour of sons, and that mothers have a stronger impact on the reading behaviour of daughters. Further, the reading behaviour of mothers appears to have a stronger impact on younger children's reading socialization, while the reading behaviour of fathers appears to be of higher importance for the reading socialization of older children. The findings related to the interplay of individual parental reading behaviours are inconclusive and difficult to interpret, but could inform further studies on reading socialization in the family. This study shows the importance of both parents for the reading socialization of daughters and sons, and contributes to research on reading socialization in the family.},

This study investigates a) how reading socialization activities in families and schools relate to girls’ and boys’ intrinsic reading motivation and b) whether schools can compensate for poor family reading socialization especially among boys. Analyses are performed on a sample from PISA 2018 containing 28,747 students in 1,581 schools. Results reveal that girls benefit more from family reading socialization and a good disciplinary climate in classrooms than boys. Boys benefit more than girls from a competitive learning climate in school and teachers’ active stimulation of reading engagement. The latter particularly stimulates the intrinsic reading motivation of boys who received little family reading socialization.},

Using data on sales of 8.9 million individual titles at Amazon, 2018-2021, along with information on 200 million ratings of 1.8 million books by 800,000 Goodreads users, I develop measures of both the supply of new books by male and female authors, as well as their usage by heterogeneous consumers. I show that growth in female-authored books has delivered a roughly equal proportionate increase in the female-authored shares of consumption, book awards, and other measures of success, indicating both that the additional female-authored books are useful to consumers and that product quality is unpredictable. I calibrate a simple structural model of demand with unpredictable product quality to quantify the welfare benefit from the additional female-authored books. While revenue gains to female authors come partly at the expense of male authors, gains to consumers from inclusive innovation are experienced by a wide range of consumers.},

	abstract = {Before about 1840, there was little prestige attached to the writing of novels, and most English novelists were women. By the turn of the twentieth century, "men of letters" acclaimed novels as a form of great literature, and most critically successful novelists were men. In the book, sociologist Gaye Tuchman examines how men succeeded in redefining a form of culture and in invading a white-collar occupation previously practiced mostly by women.
Tuchman documents how men gradually supplanted women as novelists once novel-writing was perceived as potentially profitable, in part because of changes in the system of publishing and rewarding authors. Drawing on unusual data ranging from the archives of Macmillan and company (London) to an analysis of the lives and accomplishments of authors listed in the Dictionary of National Biography, she shows that rising literacy and the centralization of the publishing industry in London after 1840 increased literary opportunities and fostered men’s success as novelists. Men redefined the nature of a good novel and applied a double standard in critically evaluating literary works by men and by women. They also received better contracts than women for novels of equivalent quality and sales. They were able to accomplish this, says Tuchman, because they were to a large extent the culture brokers – the publishers, publishers’ readers, and reviewers of an elite art form.
Both a sociological study of occupational gender transformation and a historical study of writing and publishing, this book will be a rich resource for students of the sociology of culture, literary criticism, and women’s studies.},
