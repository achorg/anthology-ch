Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.},

  abstract = {The increasing capacities of large language models (LLMs) have been shown to present an unprecedented opportunity to scale up data analytics in the humanities and social sciences, by automating complex qualitative tasks otherwise typically carried out by human researchers. While numerous benchmarking studies have assessed the analytic prowess of LLMs, there is less focus on operationalizing this capacity for inference and hypothesis testing. Addressing this challenge, a systematic framework is argued for here, building on mixed methods quantitizing and converting design principles, and feature analysis from linguistics, to transparently integrate human expertise and machine scalability. Replicability and statistical robustness are discussed, including how to incorporate machine annotator error rates in subsequent inference. The approach is discussed and demonstrated in over a dozen LLM-assisted case studies, covering 9 diverse languages, multiple disciplines and tasks, including analysis of themes, stances, ideas, and genre compositions; linguistic and semantic annotation, interviews, text mining and event cause inference in noisy historical data, literary social network construction, metadata imputation, and multimodal visual cultural analytics. Using hypothesis-driven topic classification instead of "distant reading" is discussed. The replications among the experiments also illustrate how tasks previously requiring protracted team effort or complex computational pipelines can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in a fraction of the time. Importantly, the approach is not intended to replace, but to augment and scale researcher expertise and analytic practices. With these opportunities in sight, qualitative skills and the ability to pose insightful questions have arguably never been more critical.},

Historical NER presents unique challenges due to language change through time, spelling variation, limited availability of digitized data (and, in particular, labeled data), and errors introduced by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) processes. Leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of prompt-answering LLMs, we address these challenges by prompting the model to extract entities such as persons, locations, organizations, and dates from historical documents. We then conduct an extensive error analysis of the model output in order to identify and address potential weaknesses in the entity recognition process. The results show that, while such models display ability for extracting named entities, their overall performance is lackluster. Our analysis reveals that model performance is significantly affected by hallucinations in the model output, as well as by challenges imposed by the evaluation of NER output.},

We use textual features to model realism in a large corpus of Danish-language novels. We compare the features driving that model to the ones that were important to the historical and critical development of realism as a literary project. And we use the results of our model to study the interplay between realism and social history. Our findings suggest that realism was more prominent and more widely distributed in Danish-language novels of the late nineteenth century than the critical tradition has usually acknowledged. Women appear to have written realist fiction not only at rates similar to men, but at times and with features that are difficult to distinguish from their male counterparts.

Along with different findings, the paper highlights key issues related to the arbitrariness of `what constitutes a book review,' digitisation and annotation issues and differences between frequency-based and BERT methods. We conclude by suggesting that nuanced text mining of specific types of newspaper articles benefits from considering both contextual and computational perspectives, which can together enhance our understanding of the complexities involved.},

  abstract = {In Denmark, the first actual towns can be dated to the eighth and ninth centuries. The establishment of towns became more significant in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in connection with the state-building process, and these towns were distinctly consumer towns serving as administrative, religious and military centres. From 1200 to 1350 Denmark, similar to the German area, underwent considerable urbanization; a large number of market towns were created, and in contrast to the older ones they were mercantile towns. Denmark thus clearly became the most urbanized country in Scandinavia. As Copenhagen grew in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the urban system decisively changed its character in the direction of a primate system. The characteristics of the primate system are particularly distinct within the boundaries of the Kingdom of Denmark, but less pronounced if the entire monarchy is included in the period in which Denmark was a conglomerate state. The institutional conditions must in general be attributed considerable importance in explaining Danish urban development. Thus, Denmark is one of the countries where town privileges were of great significance until the middle of the nineteenth century.},

The Enevaeldens Nyheder Online (ENO) dataset provides a reconstruction of the contents of major newspapers in Denmark and Norway during the period of Absolutism (1660-1849). The dataset contains approx. 474 million words, created using neural networks designed to process digitised microfilm versions of Danish newspapers as well as a smaller selection of Norwegian publications that were all hitherto illegible for computers. The contributions details this process and its results, including a way to derive standalone texts from the editions, and the accompanying BERT-model trained on a beta-version of the dataset.},
