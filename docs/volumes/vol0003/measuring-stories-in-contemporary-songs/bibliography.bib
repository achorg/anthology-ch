In this work, we focus on detecting the local degree of narrativity in texts, using short text passages. We performed a human annotation experiment on 325 English texts ranging across 20 genres to capture readers' perception by means of three cognitive aspects: suspense, curiosity, and surprise. We then employed a linear regression model to predict narrativity scores for 17,372 texts. When comparing our average annotation scores to similar annotation experiments with different cognitive aspects, we found that Pearson{'}s r ranges from .63 to .75. When looking at the calculated narrative probabilities, Pearson{'}s r is .91. We found that it is possible to use suspense, curiosity and surprise to detect narrativity. However, there are still differences between methods. This does not imply that there are inherently correct methods, but rather suggests that the underlying definition of narrativity is a determining factor for the results of the computational models employed."

However, the task faces three significant challenges: (1) inter-narrative heterogeneity, or the variation in narrative communication across social contexts; (2) intra-narrative heterogeneity, or the dynamic variation of narrative features within a single text over time; and (3) the lack of theoretical consensus regarding the concept of narrative. This paper introduces the NarraDetect dataset, a comprehensive resource comprising over 13,000 passages from 18 distinct narrative and non-narrative genres. Through a manually annotated subset of {\textasciitilde}400 passages, we also introduce a novel theoretical framework for annotating for a scalar concept of ``narrativity.'' Our findings indicate that while supervised models outperform large language models (LLMs) on this dataset, LLMs exhibit stronger generalization and alignment with the scalar concept of narrativity."

Our dataset is sampled from hundreds of popular English-language Reddit communities ranging across 33 topic categories, and it contains fine-grained expert annotations, including binary story labels, story spans, and event spans. We evaluate a range of detection methods using our data, and we identify the distinctive textual features of online storytelling, focusing on storytelling spans, which we introduce as a new task. We illuminate distributional characteristics of storytelling on a large community-centric social media platform, and we also conduct a case study on r/ChangeMyView, where storytelling is used as one of many persuasive strategies, illustrating that our data and models can be used for both inter- and intra-community research. Finally, we discuss implications of our tools and analyses for narratology and the study of online communities."

We construct a fine-grained bottom-up taxonomy of crowd workers' varied and nuanced perceptions of storytelling by open-coding their free-text rationales. Through comparative analyses at the label and code level, we illuminate patterns of disagreement among crowd workers and across other annotation contexts, including prescriptive labeling from researchers and LLM-based predictions. Notably, plot complexity, references to generalized or abstract actions, and holistic aesthetic judgments (such as a sense of cohesion) are especially important in disagreements. Our empirical findings broaden understanding of the types, relative importance, and contentiousness of features relevant to narrative detection, highlighting opportunities for future work on reader-contextualized models of narrative reception."

However, full-scale application of DNNs in safety-critical areas is hindered by their black box-like nature, which makes their inner workings nontransparent. As a response to the black box problem, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has recently emerged and is currently rapidly growing. The present survey is concerned with perturbation-based XAI methods, which allow to explore DNN models by perturbing their input and observing changes in the output. We present an overview of the most recent research focusing on the differences and similarities in the applications of perturbation-based methods to different data types, from extensively studied perturbations of images to the just emerging research on perturbations of video, natural language, software code, and reinforcement learning entities.},

 abstract = {Emerging in the early 1970s, the work of Outlaw country artists might be heard as exploring a crisis of masculinity resulting from developments in the women's liberation movement. Building on recent research in recorded sound studies, this essay explores how the vocal staging practices deployed in Outlaw country recordings offer a unique musical exploration of the duality of the outlaw's masculinity. Using case studies drawn from Waylon Jennings' Outlaw-era recordings, this article examines how Jennings, working with co-producers 'Cowboy' Jack Clement, Chips Moman and Willie Nelson, among others, deployed vocal staging practices in conjunction with other musical practices to construct narratives that reveal the 'outlaw' character's psychological turmoil and reflect the complicated state of working-class American masculinity in the age of women's liberation.},

That popular music texts may nevertheless contain elements of narration is hardly in doubt, however, as is shown by such songs as The Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' (1968), Kate Bush's 'Wuthering Heights' (1978), or The Buggies' 'Video Killed the Radio Star' (1979). But narrative structures truly come into their own at the point where albums begin to function as significant units of music organization. Referring primarily to Genesis's The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) and The Who's Quadrophenia (1973), this article explores the ways in which music, lyrics, prose, art work, and other elements can be used to create and describe both single and multiple narratives.},

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",
