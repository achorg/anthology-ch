    abstract  = {Transition-based dependency parsers usually use transition systems that monotonically extend partial parse states until they identify a complete parse tree. Honnibal et al. (2013) showed that greedy one-best parsing accuracy can be improved by adding additional non-monotonic transitions that permit the parser to “repair” earlier parsing mistakes by “over-writing” earlier parsing decisions. This increases the size of the set of complete parse trees that each partial parse state can derive, enabling such a parser to escape the “garden paths” that can trap monotonic greedy transition-based dependency parsers. We describe a new set of non-monotonic transitions that permits a partial parse state to derive a larger set of completed parse trees than previous work, which allows our parser to escape from a larger set of garden paths. A parser with our new non-monotonic transition system has 91.85\% directed attachment accuracy, an improve ment of 0.6\% over a comparable parser using the standard monotonic arc-eager transitions.},

@ONLINE{hu2021a,
    abstract    = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at this https URL.},

Thus, in passages of ‘internal focalization’, the narrative ‘mimics’ the character’s perspective and tells only what is accessible to the character. This narrative technique is pervasive in fictional narratives but it is notoriously hard to define. In this article, we argue that ‘internal focalization’ can be defined as the mandate to imagine perceiving from a character’s point of view. In investigating how internal focalization lets us see through a character’s eyes, we develop an account of internal focalization that relies on a particular type of imagination as its defining feature.},

    doi = {10.26417/237rwf56t},
    abstract = {A literary character is a structural and semantic element of the whole literary work. Depending on the point of view from which it is observed, the dominant spiritual-scientific background and the genre in which it appears, a literary character is also called a hero, character, figure, agent or actor. It is an instance of a literary text that is one of the structural elements of a literary work, but at the same time it is an independent system.The terms "literary character" and "character" are often identified, but at the same time differences are discerned in the context of the use of these terms. In this sense, the character is generally understood as a broader concept, while the character is attributed to people where a certain individuality and relative stability in change is assumed.The vagueness of the term character is conditioned by its general use in everyday speech in the ethical and psychological sense as a positive or negative definition of an individual and a description of his certain mental characteristics primarily those related to attitudes, emotional relationships and motivations. It is precisely this use of the term character in everyday speech, in the teaching of literature, that makes the term itself close and topical to students. Therefore, character as a structural part of a literary work is often imposed as a starting point for the interpretation of a literary work in the teaching of literature. However, this vagueness of the notion of character in the traditional analysis of character in literary works is reflected in the way that the characters of a literary work are often reduced to an assessment of their ethical attitude or attention is paid to whether it is a positive or negative character. In this way, the fictionality of a literary character is lost sight of as a phenomenon that exists exclusively in a literary work that only "gives" it ethical properties and psychological characteristics. Unlike traditional literary-scientific analysis, the newer science of literature in character analysis regularly focuses on the process of characterization, which has had a significant positive effect on the methodological approach to the literary character in the teaching of literature.},

In order to overcome the various problems of some prominent existing typologies, two crosscutting distinctions may be used.

The first distinction makes use of the opposition of "flat" and "round" characters. The second distinction recognizes the textual and the constructed levels of the literary work of art. The opposition of flat and round can be applied to both levels. A character may get a flat or a round attention on the textual level of the literary work, and he may be perceived as flat or round on the constructed level. Consequently, four categories emerge: the "pure" type, the individual-like type, the "pure" individual, and the type-like individual.},

Grounds for choosing among them in any individual case are both methodological and text dependent. Character as a mimetic unit always includes narrative agents and may include the narrator or textual speaker in general. Narrative agents can be characterized directly by the narrator or indirectly, through dynamic, static, and formal motives. In the latter case, the agent's properties must be inferred, employing inner literary and/or referential rules and models (Mead). Typologies of mimetic characters may be based on the textual means of their presentation or on literary stereotypes and social and psychological models.

We find that the {SAGE} model of text generation, which highlights deviations from a background lexical distribution, is an effective method of weighting the words of characters' utterances. Our results show that it is indeed possible to distinguish characters by their speech in the plays of canonical writers such as George Bernard Shaw, whereas characters are clustered more closely in the works of lesser-known playwrights.},

We argue that this is a simplification which leads to an overgeneralized interpretation of the results, as it does not take into account who experiences an emotion and why. Emotions play a crucial role in the interaction between characters and the events they are involved in. Until today, no specific corpora that capture such an interaction were available for literature. We aim at filling this gap and present a publicly available corpus based on Project Gutenberg, {REMAN} (Relational {EMotion} {ANnotation}), manually annotated for spans which correspond to emotion trigger phrases and entities/events in the roles of experiencers, targets, and causes of the emotion. We provide baseline results for the automatic prediction of these relational structures and show that emotion lexicons are not able to encompass the high variability of emotion expressions and demonstrate that statistical models benefit from joint modeling of emotions with its roles in all subtasks. The corpus that we provide enables future research on the recognition of emotions and associated entities in text. It supports qualitative literary studies and digital humanities.

    abstract = {We describe a method for identifying the speakers of quoted speech in natural-language textual stories. We have assembled a corpus of more than 3,000 quotations, whose speakers (if any) are manually identified, from a collection of 19th and 20th century literature by six authors. Using rule-based and statistical learning, our method identifies candidate characters, determines their genders, and attributes each quote to the most likely speaker. We divide the quotes into syntactic classes in order to leverage common discourse patterns, which enable rapid attribution for many quotes. We apply learning algorithms to the remainder and achieve an overall accuracy of 83\%.},
