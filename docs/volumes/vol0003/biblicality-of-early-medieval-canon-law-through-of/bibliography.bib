	abstract = {The social sciences and digital humanities have recently adopted the machine learning technique of topic modeling to address research questions in their fields. This is problematic in a number of ways, some of which have not received much attention in the debate yet. This paper adds epistemological concerns centering around the interface between topic modeling and linguistic concepts and the argumentative embedding of evidence obtained through topic modeling. It concludes that topic modeling in its present state of methodological integration does not meet the requirements of an independent research method. It operates from relevantly unrealistic assumptions, is non-deterministic, cannot effectively be validated against a reasonable number of competing models, does not lock into a well-defined linguistic interface, and does not scholarly model topics in the sense of themes or content. These features are intrinsic and make the interpretation of its results prone to apophenia (the human tendency to perceive random sets of elements as meaningful patterns) and confirmation bias (the human tendency to perceptually prefer patterns that are in alignment with pre-existing biases). While partial validation of the statistical model is possible, a conceptual validation would require an extended triangulation with other methods and human ratings, and clarification of whether statistical distinctivity of lexical co-occurrence correlates with conceputal topics in any reliable way.},

It is organised as a meta-collection of Latin text corpora from various sources which can be used separately or collectively. Currently there are some 130 million words loaded from all epochs during which Latin was used. They can be searched and studied in various ways : for instance as proximity searches, time restricted searches or lemmatised searches. Word frequency lists and concordances can also be generated – all of this on any level between single work and globally. Furthermore the tool is useful for reading texts online as the user can click words to get their grammatical form resolved and dictionary entries about them displayed. The database is fed by root texts in the standardised TEI xml format which are downloadable freely in various formats (if their owners agree). Apart from Latin texts, a few Greek texts and a version of the Hebrew bible are also experimentally loaded into the database. The article explains how this resource works and what texts it currently contains, featuring graphics showing text volume per time. It ends with a few

Es ist als Metacorpus organisiert, dessen Corpora, die aus verschiedenen Quellen stammen, einzeln oder gesamthaft studiert werden können. Die Plattform enthält momentan rund 130 Millionen Wörter aus allen Epochen, in denen Latein geschrieben wurde. Vielfältige Suchfunktionen werden angeboten, z. B. Umgebungssuchen, zeitlich eingeschränkte Abfragen oder lemmatisierte Suchen. Zudem können Listen von Worthäufigkeiten und Konkordanzen einzelner Wörter generiert werden. Diese Funktionen können auf allen Ebenen, vom einzelnen Text bis zur gesamten Sammlung, ausgeführt werden. Das Tool ist auch nützlich zur schnellen Onlinelektüre, da Wörter durch Anklicken in ihrer grammatischen Form bestimmt werden und in wichtigen Wörterbüchern angezeigt werden. Standardisierte TEI xml Dateien werden in die Datenbank eingespeist ; diese und andere Formate können vom Benutzer frei heruntergeladen werden (wenn ihre Eigentümer damit einverstanden sind). Neben lateinischen Texten wurden versuchsweise einige griechische Texte und eine Version der hebräischen Bibel in die Sammlung aufgenommen.

First the main idea of reconstructive textual editing is summarised, then its steps amenable to algorithmic description are compared to similar ones in evolutionary biology. The the unequal ability of its variants to be relationship revealing is an important difference between the two fields. Two Latin texts with a complicated transmission are then introduced and used as data to illustrate some available tools in praxi. The main focus is on stemma reconstruction. Some steps of the process can already be largely automated, especially collating texts. On the whole it is found that tree-constructing software is of little help in the case of the medical text Liber Aurelii, whereas it is somewhat more helpful for Plato of Tivoli’s translation of the Centiloquium. In a concluding part, the main problems for algorithmic approaches to the stemma are discussed: incomplete witnesses leading to only partly overlapping text samples, contamination in some witnesses, and rooting the automatically generated trees.},

            Natural language modeling is used to predict or generate the next word or character of modern languages. Furthermore, statistical character-based language models have been found useful in authorship attribution analyses by studying the linguistic proximity of excerpts unknown to the model. In prior work, we modeled Homeric language and provided empirical findings regarding the authorship nature of the 48 Iliad and Odyssey books. Following this line of work, and considering the current philological views and trends, we break down the two poems further into smaller portions. By employing language modeling we identify outlying passages, indicating reduced linguistic affinity with the main body of the two works and, by extension, potentially different authorship. Our results show that some of the passages isolated as outliers by the language models were also identified as such by human researchers. We further test our methodology and models on texts of similar language and genre created by other authors, namely Hesiod’s “Theogony” and “Work and Days”.},

	abstract = {The detection of allusive text reuse is particularly challenging due to the sparse evidence on which allusive references rely---commonly based on none or very few shared words. Arguably, lexical semantics can be resorted to since uncovering semantic relations between words has the potential to increase the support underlying the allusion and alleviate the lexical sparsity. A further obstacle is the lack of evaluation benchmark corpora, largely due to the highly interpretative character of the annotation process. In the present paper, we aim to elucidate the feasibility of automated allusion detection. We approach the matter from an Information Retrieval perspective in which referencing texts act as queries and referenced texts as relevant documents to be retrieved, and estimate the difficulty of benchmark corpus compilation by a novel inter-annotator agreement study on query segmentation. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent the integration of lexical semantic information derived from distributional models and ontologies can aid retrieving cases of allusive reuse. The results show that (i) despite low agreement scores, using manual queries considerably improves retrieval performance with respect to a windowing approach, and that (ii) retrieval performance can be moderately boosted with distributional semantics.},

	abstract = {The arrival of large language models (LLMs) has provoked an urgent search for stylistic markers that could differentiate machine text from human text, but while the human-like appearance of machine text has captivated public attention, the reverse phenomenon—human text becoming machine-like—has raised much less concern. This conceptual lag is surprising given the ample historical evidence of state-backed attempts to regulate human thought. The present article proposes a new comparative framework, Perplexity Games, to leverage the predictive power of LLMs and compare the statistical properties of Maospeak, a language style that emerged during the Mao Zedong’s era in China (1949-1976), with the style of canonical modern Chinese writers, such as Eileen Chang (1920-1995) and Mo Yan (1955-). The low perplexity of Maospeak, as computed across different GPT models, suggests that the impact of ideologies on language can be compared to likelihood-maximization text-generation techniques which reduce the scope of valid sequence continuations. These findings have cognitive implications: whereas engineered languages such as Maospeak hijack the predictive mechanisms of human cognition by narrowing the space of linguistic possibilities, literature resists such cognitive constraints by dispersing the probability mass over multiple, equally valid paths. Exposure to diverse language data counters the influences of ideologies on our linguistically mediated perceptions of the world and increases the perplexity of our imaginations.},

              This chapter presents the findings of an ongoing digital project of the Helsinki Computational History Group at Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities (HELDIG) focused on the history of eighteenth-century book publication. The authors have created a historical-biographical database based on
              The English Short-Title Catalogue
              (ESTC), a standard source for analytical bibliographic research, and extracted a data-driven canon which considers changes over time, subject-topics, top-works, authors, publishers, publication place, and materiality. This chapter provides both methodological and historical insights into the development of print and demonstrates the huge analytical potential of harmonized metadata catalogs. While quantitative analyses of the book trade were attempted before, they did not engage with the complex process of canon formation at such a large scale. The authors’ work highlights the formative role played by publishers in this process and the epistemological shift started at the end of the seventeenth century, when religious works were increasingly replaced by literary works. As the authors argue, this shift in the production and consumption of print allowed for a reinvention of the canon during the eighteenth century.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to quantify, with a simple and robust measure, the distance between historical varieties of a language. The measure will be inferred from text corpora corresponding to historical periods. Different approaches have been proposed for similar aims: Language Identification, Phylogenetics, Historical Linguistics or Dialectology. In our approach, we used a perplexity-based measure to calculate language distance between all the historical periods of a specific language: European Portuguese. Perplexity has also proven to be a robust metric to calculate distance between languages. However, this measure has not been tested yet to identify diachronic periods within the historical evolution of a specific language. For this purpose, a historical Portuguese corpus has been constructed from different open sources containing texts with close original spelling. The results of our experiments show that Portuguese keeps an important degree of homogeneity over time. We anticipate this metric to be a starting point to be applied to other languages.},

	abstract = {Hibernensis introduces 'new, original contributions to canonical legislation'.
The book De contrariis causis (Dcc) "On contrary sources" demonstrates the Hibernensis' reflexive stance on matters relating to the process of legislation. What was the role of these contradictions?
Large number of passages from A-recension Dcc occur only in B-recension: undivided proto-Hib.

Contradictions occur everywhere in imperial, barbarian and canon law. Patrick Wormald's "paradox of early medieval law": "We have a considerable quantity of legislation much of it implying its relevance to the preservation of law and order; yet the texts themselves have features which, taken together, do argue against their applicability and there is remarkably little evidence for their application." (p. 10, n. 27)

Theory:
Ronald Dworkin distinguished "rule" from "principle". Rules prescribe a single valid mode of conduct. There is no room for conflicting rules (e.g. speed limits).
Principles are also legally binding, but they can conflict. They have the dimension of weight. Depending on circumstances, a principle can weigh more or less in relation to other principles.
A legal principle can provide a justification for a range of rules and established practices.
In Dcc the two conflicting principles are in the titles, while the rules they govern are cited underneath.

"Dcc was not simply a collection of juxtaposed rules and their exceptions, but a blueprint for legislation". The titles can be regarded as "newly-formulated laws (analogous to Dworkin's principles) adduced empirically from existing stipulations (analogous to Dworkin's rules) that were drawn from authoritative sources." [SM: and a blue print for the USE of law]
Dcc provides a model that showed churchmen how to form new laws, offering a creative solution to the problem of the validity of new laws (p. 14-5)
"The book Dcc could have provided judges with an example of how laws can be formulated, an example that judges could follow themselves in deciding difficult case that necessitated a re-statement of the existing laws."

This all takes its cue from biblical exegesis, as Thomas Charles-Edwards had shown before.},
