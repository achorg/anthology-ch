<span>Abstract</span>
<p>This paper outlines an in-progress educational resource created by
the DHTech Education and Training Working Group. The preliminary
resource seeks to fill a gap in the current training materials available
to people who work on the technical side of Digital Humanities projects.
It will provide resources on high-level core concepts of software
development that contextualize, rather than duplicate, existing
resources. The contribution outlines the intended workflow for producing
this resource and details the anticipated challenges and barriers to
implementation.</p>
</div>
<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In 2025, DHTech<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> ran a survey to better understand
the background and experiences of people working on technical aspects of
Digital Humanities (DH) projects. According to this survey, 39% of
respondents received their software development training through
self-directed learning.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Additionally, about 70% reported
that they are at least in part self-taught. There is nothing wrong with
being a self-taught programmer, and the majority of software developers
will be self-taught to an extent, whether to become familiar with a new
framework or learning a new programming language. Small scale
experiments and experiences suggest, however, that a formal software
engineering or computer science degree provides a deeper understanding
of computers and software development concepts <span class="citation"
data-cites="bartram2016 kimball2023">(Bartram 2016; Kimball
2023)</span>. For research software, this lack of fundamental knowledge
might contribute to some of the difficulties researchers face when
writing code. Wiese et al. found that 70% of respondents to their survey
of scientific R developers deal with technical difficulties such as
software design and maintenance <span class="citation"
data-cites="wiese2020">(Wiese et al. 2020)</span>. This is supported by
a survey of scientific R developers conducted by Pinto et al., which
found that 52% of respondents indicated they had only a novice
understanding or no understanding at all of software design <span
class="citation" data-cites="pinto2018">(Pinto et al. 2018)</span>.
While systematic studies of software development skills in the
humanities are lacking, Bleeker et al. found in a survey on “code
literacy” in DH that around two-thirds of respondents reported having
no, beginner, or intermediate levels of code literacy <span
class="citation" data-cites="bleeker2022">(Bleeker et al.
2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Given this need for self-directed learning, there is a demand for
training resources for software development. In general, there are two
types of resources: tool- or technique-specific resources and (research)
software engineering specific resources. The first type typically
focuses on a specific problem statement and how to use a certain tool or
technique to address it; such as the lessons published in the
Programming Historian<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="mullen2025 ryan2021">(Mullen ongoing; Ryan 2021)</span>.
Lessons in these resources teach, for example, how to create choropleth
maps with Python, how to work with dates in R, or how to analyze
newspapers with R. The second type of resource focuses on general
software engineering topics and is not specifically targeting DH
practitioners. The materials developed as part of the INTERSECT
project<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> are one example, as well as the Code
Refinery project,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> the Carpentries,<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Better Scientific Software,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and the US-RSE Education
&amp; Training Seminar Series.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Topics include how to
design software, how to use Git and collaborate with others using Git
and GitHub, and how to document software.</p>
<p>But there are disciplinary differences that affect the usefulness of
these resources for software developers in the humanities. This was
confirmed by the survey conducted by DHTech in 2025 which found that
over 70% of respondents worked on web applications, projects, or digital
editions, and 60% used JavaScript. In contrast, in the RSE International
Survey 2022 only 19% indicated that they used JavaScript <span
class="citation" data-cites="hettrick2022">(Hettrick et al.
2022)</span>, suggesting that web application development is not the
main task of many developers of research software outside of the
humanities.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In addition, code and software are
often not seen as primary research outputs in the humanities, which can
be a barrier to starting conversations about best practices <span
class="citation" data-cites="vanzundert2020">(Zundert et al.
2020)</span>. While the authors are not aware of any survey or study
about the differences in required skills between DH developers and
developers working in other research domains, personal experience and
anecdotal evidence suggest that there are indeed variations. Although
all of the resources listed above are highly valuable and widely used,
there is a lack of materials that contextualize and bring together the
separate topics and tutorials specifically with DH practitioners in
mind. The Education &amp; Training Working Group of DHTech<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> aims to fill this gap by offering
lessons that link to existing materials where possible and
contextualizing them as needed to provide a domain-specific
perspective.</p>
<p>The goal of these lessons is to clarify that developing software is a
multifaceted and complex process, with barriers that are unique to the
digital humanities. Any large software development project can and
should be broken down into smaller components; however, knowing how they
work together in a maintainable and efficient way can be challenging.
Therefore, we must know how to break down a problem into its constituent
steps, carry out each step, and verify its success. For example, in a
complex web application, the integration of different components, such
as maintaining a database, designing a frontend, and handling a
well-optimized and indexed search engine, requires sophisticated
knowledge of software development. The digital humanities has an
unfortunate history of projects that have disappeared from the web due
to the creators’ inability to maintain or migrate the project as its
complexity has grown.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to the complexity of web applications, inexperienced
programmers can introduce bugs or errors into the software. There are
well-known examples in the hard sciences of bugs in research software
leading to incorrect results <span class="citation"
data-cites="neupane2019">(Neupane et al. 2019)</span>. While no such
cases are known yet in DH, there is a real possibility for errors and
bugs in our field as well. Even in a web application, which may not
produce hard, verifiable results, bugs or errors in the software, such
as an improperly designed search interface, could mislead end users and
introduce errors into research. In addition, such errors matter even for
researchers who never intend to release their code to be reused or as a
web application, as they could lead to inaccurate or faulty results and
conclusions.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="there-is-work-in-working-group"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> There is “Work” in “Working
Group”</h1>
<p>The DHTech Education and Training Working Group was founded after
discussions about training and education gaps of DH developers at the
DH2023 conference. Its mission is two-fold: contextualize and bring
together existing resources, as well as creating missing resources
specifically aimed at developers of DH software. Neither of these tasks
are trivial. Gathering existing resources and contextualizing them comes
with the inherent risk of linking to outdated resources; outdated both
in terms of content but also resources that are no longer available.
While this is not an unsolvable problem, it does require an ongoing
effort to mark outdated content and potentially even remove broken links
from the materials. Additionally, while less work than composing new
materials from scratch, it also requires time to find existing
resources, vet them, and create a coherent story around them. Creating
new resources comes with similar challenges, but the effort required for
writing and reviewing materials is significantly higher.</p>
<p>The working group has created a website with lessons addressing the
above mission. The group consists at this point of four volunteer
editors that decide on the content of the website as well as the
processes in use. So far, four lessons have been created; of these, two
are published and two are in draft status. A published lesson is
considered complete when it has been reviewed by someone other than the
authors and has received a DOI to make it easily citable. A draft lesson
is still a work in progress. Additionally, the website implements the
concept of “pathways” that guide a reader through multiple lessons that
thematically belong together. While this feature is still under
development, it provides a powerful tool to provide different entry
points and suggested learning materials based on the experiences of the
reader. For instance, a lesson on Git and GitHub might be part of a
pathway addressing novice programmers and a pathway addressing readers
seeking materials for web development, allowing for the repurposing of
materials without duplicating lessons.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="the-technical-details"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> The Technical Details</h1>
<p>The website of the working group is created using the static site
generator Hugo.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Hugo is open source and written in
Go.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The website code is hosted in a
GitHub repository<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> in the DHTech GitHub organization<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> and published using GitHub Pages.<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> There are several benefits of using
GitHub’s infrastructure, including free website hosting, ease of website
updates (once changes to the content are made, a GitHub Action
automatically deploys the new version), and potential future GitHub
Actions to automate parts of the publication workflow. Additionally,
GitHub Issues lend themselves to tracking the planning and maintenance
of lessons as well as general website updates.</p>
<p>DOIs are generated through Zenodo.<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
Reviewed and accepted lessons are uploaded as PDFs into a Zenodo
collection<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> and receive a DOI. This DOI is then
added to the lesson on the working group website, along with the
finished PDF file. The benefits of depositing finished lessons in Zenodo
is that even if the working group website becomes unavailable in the
future, the lessons will still be available.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
Additionally, Zenodo allows versioning of lessons if they are updated in
the future.</p>
<p>PDFs of lessons are created using Pandoc<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
and LaTeX. The workflow requires a lesson to be available as a Markdown
file, which is the default format for Hugo pages. The benefit of this
process is that the PDF generation could be done automatically using
GitHub Actions. Setting up such a GitHub Action is planned as a future
work element of the repository.</p>
<p>In addition, the working group anticipates that the next step towards
sustainability and the incorporation of existing outside materials is to
add a URL checker in a GitHub action, and retire technically outdated
material in the lessons as modeled by the Programming Historian.<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="challenges"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Challenges</h2>
<p>In the absence of any formal humanities institution for education and
training in software development, the project is hindered at the moment
by being a purely volunteer effort. Creating content takes time, which
means progress is slow. However, with the infrastructure and processes
now in place, adding new content is becoming easier. The ultimate goal
is to create a community around this project to create new lessons and
maintain existing ones. This requires, however, that there is enough
incentive for volunteers to contribute which is why the group provides a
DOI for published lessons: so they can be listed on a CV. In general, DH
has long grappled with crediting practitioners for research outputs
other than a traditional paper or article <span class="citation"
data-cites="nowviskie2011">(Nowviskie 2011)</span>; the inclusion of a
DOI brings these training resources closer to a traditional research
output. This is one approach to encourage contributions, and there may
be others that could be explored in the future, such as further
recognition for reviewers, or cataloging lessons for inclusion in other
repositories of software engineering or digital humanities educational
materials. It is the hope of this working group that once sufficient
community has been built around the project, non-volunteer sources of
labor may be feasible.</p>
<p>Maintenance of lessons is another challenge. Technologies become
outdated and resources may become unreachable. The planned approach to
combat this problem is three-fold. First, focusing more on concepts and
processes rather than specific technologies may make lessons less likely
to become obsolete. Second, one task of the editorial team of the
working group is to periodically evaluate lessons for relevance and, if
necessary, ask the author or another volunteer to update them. The
future integration of an automated URL checker for URLs referenced in
lessons would alleviate some of the workload, as well as, thirdly, the
development of a lesson retirement policy, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>One question that many projects creating training resources must
consider is how AI might change both the creation process and the
content. Up to this point, the members of the working group see AI as a
useful tool to be more efficient in developing software, but not as a
replacement for well-designed, domain-specific training resources.
Software development in general, and not just in DH, is actively
grappling with the effects of generative AI on workflows, productivity,
and training. Recent studies on the impact of AI on software development
have been inconclusive. Two recent studies <span class="citation"
data-cites="coutinho2024 cui2025">(Coutinho et al. 2024; Cui et al.
2025)</span> found generative AI had a positive effect on productivity
in large software companies, while another <span class="citation"
data-cites="becker2025">(Becker et al. 2025)</span> found a negative
effect on productivity for open source software developers. In a recent
study on the use of AI by scientists who write code, O’Brien found that
scientific programmers without formal education in computer science used
AI in place of official documentation, and that they often struggled to
verify the output of AI-generated code <span class="citation"
data-cites="obrien2025">(O’Brien 2025)</span>. The members of the
working group are concerned about the effects these tools may have on
errors and code maintainability, which makes robust training resources
even more essential. In addition to using AI to write code, other
advances in AI research could have effects on DH as well. For instance,
the rise in the training or fine-tuning of LLM models for an
ever-increasing number of humanities tasks, such as OCR correction,<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> will obligate the inclusion of AI
software development and maintenance into the selection of lessons even
if it is not used for our content creation and maintenance work.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="future-work"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Future Work</h1>
<p>The most critical next task is to continue writing lessons and
building out pathway lessons. This might include asking for feedback
from the community and recruiting volunteers to work through the
lessons. Furthermore, the editorial team will have to decide what topics
to cover to ensure a coherent set of lessons.</p>
<p>Similarly important is the establishment of a community around the
working group. Once a list of desired lesson topics exists, contributors
can be recruited to write and review lesson materials. The long-term
vision for the working group is a standing board of contributors and
editors that support and maintain the website and materials. From a
process perspective, while the infrastructure to review lessons is in
place (utilizing GitHub pull requests), a more formal review process
still needs to be established. This is particularly important if the
number of concurrent lessons being developed continues to grow.</p>
<p>Lastly, the potential for connecting with existing efforts needs to
be explored. At this moment, the working group is not yet at the point
where this would be sensible, however, the long-term goal is to produce
new lessons and materials in collaboration with other initiatives. This
might include organizing collaboration workshops or similar events,
which would also allow the group to continue filling the gap of
materials for software developers in the humanities while reaching a
wider group of practitioners in the digital humanities, making them
aware of the hard work needed to keep our software working every
day.</p>

questions specifically geared towards the type of tasks developers of
research software worked on. Hence, JavaScript is the strongest
indicator regarding the question whether the respondent participated in
web application development.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back"
