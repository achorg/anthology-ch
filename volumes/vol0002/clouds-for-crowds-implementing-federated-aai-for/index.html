<span>Abstract</span>
<p>Technology has been inherent to the digital humanities from the
outset. However, with the increase in data-driven research, Research
Infrastructures (RI) such as DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for
the Arts and Humanities) need to ensure secure access to the data, tools
and workflows they offer. Furthermore, collaboration with other RIs
through initiatives such as OSCARS (Open Science Clusters’s Action for
Research and Society) and compatibility with the European Open Science
Cloud (EOSC) are becoming increasingly important. It is within this
context that this article aims to highlight the necessity and advantages
of implementing federated identity management and authorisation. It
describes the technological background of such an Authentication and
Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI) solution for the digital humanities.
Finally, it motivates the DHTech community to adopt the AARC Blueprint
Architecture supported by a Compendium being developed in the context of
the AARC-TREE project.</p>

<h1 data-number="1"
id="research-infrastructure-for-the-arts-and-humanities"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Research Infrastructure for the
Arts and Humanities</h1>
<p>DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and
Humanities) <span class="citation" data-cites="web_dariah">[<a
href="#ref-web_dariah" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> is a European
research infrastructure that provides a platform for researchers in the
arts and humanities to access, share, and preserve digital resources and
tools <span class="citation" data-cites="sshoc_marketplace">[<a
href="#ref-sshoc_marketplace" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>. DARIAH
aims to enhance and support digitally-enabled research in the arts and
humanities, fostering collaboration, innovation and knowledge-sharing
across disciplines and borders <span class="citation"
data-cites="chambers_2025_14881627">[<a
href="#ref-chambers_2025_14881627" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>.
The infrastructure offers a range of services, including repositories,
virtual research environments, and authentication and authorisation
mechanisms, to support the research lifecycle and facilitate the
creation, publication, and preservation of digital scholarship. By
providing a shared infrastructure and community-driven approach, DARIAH
enables researchers to work together more effectively, leveraging
digital methods and tools to advance our understanding of human culture
and society. The technical foundation for this shared infrastructure is
provided by the DARIAH AAI (Authentication and Authorisation
Infrastructure) .</p>
<p>This paper provides an overview of the DARIAH AAI from the authors’
perspective. One author is one of the developers of the DARIAH AAI, one
is responsible for its current operation, and one holds a management
position within DARIAH. This paper provides insights into the technical
aspects of the DARIAH infrastructure with the goal to encourage others
to build on top of DARIAH AAI by following AAI best practices, and to
showcase a sustainable integration pathway for DH services and DH
communities into the global research infrastructure landscape.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="aai-for-dariah"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> AAI for DARIAH</h1>
<p>The DARIAH AAI <span class="citation" data-cites="web_dariahaai">[<a
href="#ref-web_dariahaai" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> is a
federated identity management system designed to facilitate secure and
seamless access to data, tools and workflows for researchers in the
humanities and arts. By leveraging federated authentication and
authorisation, service providers can benefit from improved security,
reduced administrative burdens, and enhanced user experience. Federated
authentication allows users to access multiple services with a single
set of credentials (e.g. their home institution login), eliminating the
need for multiple usernames and passwords. This approach also enables
service providers to outsource identity management to trusted identity
providers, reducing the risk of password breaches and minimising the
administrative effort required to manage user accounts. Furthermore,
federated authorisation enables fine-grained access control, allowing
developers to define and enforce precise access policies based on user
attributes, group memberships and roles. From the user perspective, the
DARIAH AAI also allows for single sign-on (SSO), i.e. the user
authenticates once after connecting to a first application and is then
automatically authenticated for all other federated applications they
want to use the same day. By adopting the DARIAH AAI, service providers
and developers can focus on delivering high-quality services to their
users, while relying on a robust and scalable infrastructure to manage
authentication and authorisation.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="technological-background"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Technological Background</h1>
<p>The technological background of DARIAH AAI is provided using
established technologies and standardised protocols for federated
identity management, as summarised below. More background information
can be found in Chapter 3.3.3, <em>Access control to research data in
the frame of FAIR principles and open access</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="erzsebet_toth_czifra_2023_8059626">[<a
href="#ref-erzsebet_toth_czifra_2023_8059626"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>.</p>
<p> <strong>SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).</strong> The
DARIAH AAI uses SAML as the primary protocol for exchanging
authentication and authorisation information between identity providers
and service providers. SAML allows for the secure exchange of user
attributes and authentication statements between parties.</p>
<p> <strong>OpenID Connect (OIDC).</strong> In addition to SAML, the
DARIAH AAI also supports OIDC, an authentication protocol built on top
of the OAuth 2.0 framework. OIDC provides a simpler and more lightweight
alternative to SAML for authentication and authorisation.</p>
<p> <strong>OAuth 2.0.</strong> The DARIAH AAI also supports OAuth 2.0
as the authorisation framework for managing access to protected
resources. OAuth 2.0 provides a standardised mechanism for clients to
request access to resources on behalf of the user.</p>
<p> <strong>Shibboleth and SimpleSAMLphp.</strong> The DARIAH AAI is
based on the Shibboleth and simpleSAMLphp open source software systems,
which provide a robust and scalable framework for managing identity
federation. Both products support SAML and OIDC, and can provide a
single sign-on (SSO) experience across both protocols.</p>
<p> <strong>Role-based Access Control (RBAC).</strong> The DARIAH AAI
implements RBAC as a policy-based approach to access control. It allows
for fine-grained access control decisions based on user roles,
affiliations and permissions.</p>
<p> <strong>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).</strong> The
DARIAH AAI uses LDAP as a directory service for storing and managing
user attributes and identity information, as well as group memberships
and roles.</p>
<p> <strong>SP/IdP Proxy (Service Provider / Identity Provider
Proxy).</strong> DARIAH’s SP/IdP proxy simplifies the connection of
services and identity sources to the infrastructure. This mechanism
enables any DARIAH related attributes (e.g. member of a specific
research project), to be provided, in addition to the attributes
provided by the home organisation.</p>
<p>The DARIAH AAI is designed to support federation, which means that it
allows multiple identity providers and service providers to participate
in the infrastructure. This enables users to access multiple services
with a single set of credentials, while also allowing service providers
to outsource identity management to trusted identity providers. It
interconnects, for example, with eduGAIN <span class="citation"
data-cites="web_eduGAIN">[<a href="#ref-web_eduGAIN"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>, the interfederation of national
research federations world-wide. Thus a researcher from a country that
is part of the interfederation can access federated services world-wide
by using the credentials managed by their home organisation.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:dariahaai1">1</a> depicts the DARIAH AAI
architecture.</p>
<figure id="fig:dariahaai1" data-latex-placement="t!">
<a href="figures/Figure_dariahaai1-v2.png" data-lightbox="figures" data-title="Figure 1: The Architecture of the DARIAH Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure."><img
src="figures/Figure_dariahaai1-v2.png" style="width:70.0%" /></a>
<figcaption>Figure 1: The Architecture of the DARIAH Authentication and
Authorisation Infrastructure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The DARIAH SP/IdP Proxy allows authentication for (1) users from
every IdPs interfederated in eduGAIN, as well as for (2) so-called
“homeless” users from the DARIAH “homeless” IdP, where any humanities
researcher can register for an account including independent researchers
without an institutional affiliation. For users of both categories
("eduGAIN" or "homeless"), DARIAH-specific rights and privileges can be
managed with the DARIAH group membership management. This enables the
proxy to transfer user attributes from the IdP where the authentication
took place, as well as membership attributes from the DARIAH virtual
organisation to the DARIAH services.</p>
<p>By leveraging the above mentioned standard technologies and
protocols, the DARIAH AAI provides a robust, scalable and secure system
for managing identity and access control in the context of the research
landscape. The majority of the design decisions made for the DARIAH AAI
are compliant with the globally recognised AARC Blueprint
Architecture.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="aarc-blueprint-architecture"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> AARC Blueprint Architecture</h1>
<p>The AARC (Authentication and Authorisation for Research and
Collaboration) Blueprint Architecture <span class="citation"
data-cites="aarc_community_members_2019_3672785">[<a
href="#ref-aarc_community_members_2019_3672785"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span> is a comprehensive framework for
designing and implementing federated authentication and authorisation
infrastructures for research communities. Developed through three phases
of AARC projects <span class="citation" data-cites="web_AARC">[<a
href="#ref-web_AARC" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>, the Blueprint
provides a set of guidelines, policies and architectures for building
scalable and secure identity management systems. DARIAH AAI implements
the main components of AARC, including: <strong>(1) Policy
Framework</strong>, which defines the rules and guidelines for identity
management and access control; <strong>(2) Proxy-based
Architecture</strong>, which outlines the technical design and
components of the infrastructure; <strong>(3) Standards and
Protocols</strong>, which specify the interoperability standards for
identity federation and attribute-based access control; and <strong>(4)
Governance</strong>, which establishes the organisational and
operational structures for managing the infrastructure. By following the
AARC Blueprint, research organisations and communities can establish
robust and trustworthy identity management systems (like DARIAH AAI), to
enable secure and seamless collaboration and access to shared resources
and services.</p>
<p>The current AARC TREE project (AARC Technical Revision to Enhance
Effectiveness) <span class="citation" data-cites="web_aarc_tree">[<a
href="#ref-web_aarc_tree" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span> drives the
next phase of integration for research infrastructures. It expands
federated access management to integrate user-centred technologies and
access to federated data and services (authorisation), as well as
defining common strategies for the development, deployment and
sustainability of AAIs. A key aim of the AARC TREE project is to foster
the uptake of the AARC Blueprint Architecture and Guidelines by research
infrastructures and their communities such as DARIAH. This work is
supported by the development of a Compendium of AARC best practices and
recommendations for a common long-term strategy for AAI services in
pan-European Research Infrastructures in Europe. Furthermore, this work
will lay the foundations for ensuring that the AAIs are compatible with
the European Open Science Cloud.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="eosc-and-pan-european-e-infrastructures"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> EOSC and pan-European
e-Infrastructures</h1>
<p>The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) <span class="citation"
data-cites="web_eosc">[<a href="#ref-web_eosc"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span> is a virtual environment that brings
together research communities, data repositories, and service providers
to enable seamless access to research data, services, and resources. The
EOSC Federation <span class="citation"
data-cites="eosc_association_2025_14999577">[<a
href="#ref-eosc_association_2025_14999577"
role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span> enables the distributed management
of such data, knowledge and resources for European research, fostering
collaboration, innovation, and the uptake of open science.</p>
<p>At the heart of the EOSC Federation are the EOSC Nodes, which are
national or thematic hubs that provide access to research services,
data, and resources. EOSC Nodes are responsible for aggregating and
providing services, data, and resources from their respective domains,
making them available to the broader research community through the EOSC
Federation. Each Node acts as a gateway to the EOSC, providing a single
point of access to a wide range of research services, including data
repositories, computing resources, and software tools. By connecting to
the EOSC Federation through the Nodes, researchers can access a vast
array of resources and services, facilitating collaboration, data
sharing, and innovation across disciplines and borders. The EOSC Nodes
play a crucial role in realising the vision of the EOSC, enabling the
creation of a unified, open, and accessible research environment for
European scientists. The basis of the EOSC Federation is the EOSC AAI as
described in <span class="citation"
data-cites="kanellopoulos_2025_15388270">[<a
href="#ref-kanellopoulos_2025_15388270"
role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>, which interoperates with the DARIAH
AAI.</p>
<figure id="fig:dariahaai2" data-latex-placement="t!">
<a href="figures/Figure_dariahaai2-v2.png" data-lightbox="figures" data-title="Figure 2: Interoperation between DARIAH-AAI and Services of a Research Infrastructure."><img

<figcaption>Figure 2: Interoperation between DARIAH-AAI and Services of
a Research Infrastructure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>DARIAH AAI’s interoperability with pan-European e-infrastructures has
already been successfully validated by various proof of concepts
implementations (PoC). For instance, <span class="citation"
data-cites="dariah_poc">[<a href="#ref-dariah_poc"
role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> showcases how DARIAH-AAI users could
access services from other e-infrastructures, by using the DARIAH AAI
proxy as presented in the Figure <a href="#fig:dariahaai2">2</a>. The
Figure also shows how the DARIAH-AAI proxy provides a powerful layer of
identity harmonisation (account linking capabilities) by interacting
with other infrastructure proxies (like EGI’s Check-In service or the
EOSC EU Node’s MyAccessID service).</p>
<p>With the European Open Science Cloud entering its build-up phase,
such federated access is crucial for enabling humanities researchers to
connect to the wealth of data, services and resources available. Based
on these undertakings it is now possible to productively login to the
EOSC EU Node, via the DARIAH AAI.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Robust federated identity management and authorisation for research
infrastructures such as DARIAH is becoming increasingly essential. By
ensuring that the DARIAH-AAI is compatible with the AARC Blueprint
Architecture and related initiatives such as EOSC, its adoption not only
helps to simplify the management of access control and authorisation for
DH service providers, but also reduces administrative burdens and most
importantly, improves the overall user experience for researchers in the
humanities and arts.</p>
