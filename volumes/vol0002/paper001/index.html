<span>Abstract</span>
<p>We present and introduce the proceedings from the Digital Humanities
Tech Symposium 2025, a one-day workshop organized by DHTech and held at
the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) 2025 conference
in Lisbon, Portugal. We provide background on DHTech (an ADHO Special
Interest Group), discuss the challenges of presenting and publishing on
the technical aspects of work in Digital Humanities, and describe the
submission and review process for the Symposium presentations and
proceedings papers. We conclude with reflections on the challenges of
writing about and reviewing technical work such as the papers included
in this volume, and our hopes for continuing to improving the spaces and
processes for this work in the future.</p>
</div>
<p>We are pleased to introduce the first-ever published proceedings from
a DHTech event, the <em>Digital Humanities Tech Symposium 2025</em>, a
one-day workshop held at the Alliance of Digital Humanities
Organizations (ADHO) 2025 conference in Lisbon, Portugal. Ever since its
founding after a workshop at DH2017 in Montreal, DHTech has been active
in organizing workshops, mini-conferences and meet-ups to foster
community and share knowledge. Once DHTech became an official ADHO
Special Interest Group (SIG) in 2021 <span class="citation"
data-cites="noauthor_adho_nodate">(<em><span>ADHO</span>
<span>Special</span> <span>Interest</span> <span>Group</span></em>,
n.d.)</span>, we have organized pre-conference workshops every year for
the annual ADHO conference.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We make an effort to
document and share the outcome of our events, especially since we know
the DHTech community is geographically distributed in ways that make a
single meeting time impossible for everyone to join. Our event
post-publications range from informal blog posts writing up
conversations and resources from virtual meet-ups, to white papers like
the one that came out of a workshop at the DH2019 conference in Utrecht
<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_dh_nodate">(<em>The

review, which expanded on a poster presented by members of the DHTech
Code Review Working group at DH2022 <span class="citation"

<p>DHTech is an international grassroots community of people in the
Digital Humanities (DH) community whose professional responsibilities
involve the development of research software; members include research
software engineers, database specialists, computational researchers, and
others. While there is increasing alignment between the traditional DH
developer role and the Research Software Engineer (RSE), the community
intentionally includes people in many different roles and not everyone
identifies as developer or RSE. DHTech was established to “support the
development and reuse of software in the Digital Humanities by providing
a community to exchange knowledge, share expertise, and foster
collaboration” <span class="citation"
data-cites="noauthor_about_nodate">(<em>About <span>DHTech</span></em>,
n.d.)</span>. Our mission is to establish and improve practices related
to developing and maintaining research software, tools, and
infrastructure in the digital humanities, topics that often receive
limited attention within the broader DH community. We advance this
mission through virtual and in-person workshops and events, working
groups, and other efforts. We know from a recent survey on Research
Software Engineering in DH that the technical community is quite
dispersed, and there is no single conference everyone doing technical DH
work attends, but that the annual ADHO conference is currently the best
option for an in-person gathering <span class="citation"
data-cites="damerow_surveying_2025">(Damerow, R. Koeser, et al.
2025)</span>.</p>
<p>In spite of our commitment to presenting and sharing on the technical
aspects of Digital Humanities work, it remains difficult to find venues
to present and publish on this work. In the models of conference
material dissemination listed by the editors of this Anthology, we
typically fall between “none” and “self-archiving” <span
class="citation" data-cites="10.63744@rWDzgqfDLYNm">(Arnold et al.
2025)</span>, usually by posting materials on the <a
href="https://dh-tech.github.io/">DHTech website</a>.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> We
are grateful for the leadership of the Association for Computers and the
Humanities (ACH) and editors of the new <em>Anthology of Computers and
the Humanities</em> for their “inclusive and generous sense” of Digital
Humanities work <span class="citation"
data-cites="10.63744@rWDzgqfDLYNm">(Arnold et al. 2025)</span> and
offering opening this space for us to document and share more widely the
work of the technical community represented by DHTech. We are also
encouraged by recent developments in this space, including the <a

<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_call_nodate">(<em>Call for
<span>Proposals</span> – <span>DH2024</span></em>, n.d.)</span>.</p>
<p>The papers included in these proceedings are based on presentations
included in the <em>Digital Humanities Tech Symposium</em>, a one-day
workshop organized by DHTech held on July 14th, 2025 as part of the
pre-conference program for the DH2025 conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
The symposium inverted the typical format of presentations at the DH
conference by focusing on the technical aspects of digital humanities
projects, while still situating them within their specific research and
disciplinary contexts. Presentations ranged from implementation details
of research projects, to tool presentations and live demonstrations
touching on infrastructure, authentication, and publication platforms.
The aim of this one-day conference was to facilitate the exchange of
practical technical knowledge that participants could take back and
apply to their own work.</p>
<p>To ensure rigor, quality, and technical relevance, we implemented a
submission and review process for symposium presentations. We published
a call for presentation proposals as well as a call for reviewers;
proposals were submitted as short abstracts, with links to relevant
software packages, and were each reviewed by two volunteer reviewers
from the DHTech community. Twelve submissions were selected for the
symposium based on reviewer feedback and available time slots in the
symposium schedule. We became aware of the new <em>Anthology of
Computers and the Humanities</em> and the opportunity for published
proceedings from our symposium after the submission process was already
underway. Thus, we re-publicized the call for proposals with this
option, and communicated with all presenters to determine their interest
and capacity for expanding their presentations into a short paper to be
published in the proceedings. While not all presenters were interested
or able to contribute, there was enough interest to warrant publishing
the proceedings. The papers included here represent a strong
cross-section of the technical work showcased at the symposium, and we
look forward to see publications in other venues on the symposium
presentations that are not represented here.</p>
<p>With over 60 pre-registrations, the symposium was fully booked and
saw strong attendance. We started the day with over 40 attendees, which
included walk-in attendees who did not pre-register for the workshop,
and we had a peak audience of around 50 participants. Based on an
informal Mentimeter poll at the beginning of the symposium, nearly
everyone who participated in the poll (26 out of 27) programs as part of
their work (all the time or sometimes), and 17 out of 28 came to the
symposium for the technical talks. This attendance and engagement
demonstrates the strong interest of the DH community in understanding
and learning from the technical aspects of DH work.</p>
<p>Symposium presenters who opted to write a paper for the proceedings
were encouraged to draft their papers before the symposium, and were
given a deadline to submit a final version two weeks after the DH2025
conference. Our goal was to take advantage of the proceedings
publication model for “rapid dissemination and citation of work that has
been presented to and reviewed by experts” <span class="citation"
data-cites="10.63744@rWDzgqfDLYNm">(Arnold et al. 2025)</span>, and to
avoid the work becoming outdated due to the fast pace of change of
technology. We recruited a second round of reviewers, which included
paper authors as well as other DHTech members who attended the
symposium, and facilitated a second review process. Each paper was
reviewed by two people within a time frame of about two weeks. The
Proceedings Committee, which consisted of the members of the DHTech
Steering Committee, read through and discussed all reviews. Authors
revised their papers in response to reviewer comments and then further
refined their papers based on more detailed feedback from the
proceedings editors, Damerow and Koeser. It is worth noting that we did
not provide specific review guidelines to the reviewers, giving them the
freedom to independently determine which aspects of the papers and
related code to focus on. Based on our review of the responses, there
are important questions that need to be discussed further about how best
to write about and review technical work, since DH projects cover such a
wide range of humanities disciplines, technologies and methods. We look
forward to improving our process and developing more flexible and
rigorous standards as we collaborate with DH2026 conference organizers
on the review process for the technical track, as well as for future
DHTech publication opportunities.</p>
<p>The symposium was designed from the outset to include different kinds
of talks – some showcased tools, while others presented on technical
aspects of specific projects. The presentations varied widely, not only
in terms of the type of implementation (from Python packages to
multi-tier, distributed architectures), but also in focus; some
presentations highlighted practical usage of specific tools, while
others detailed the underlying processes and design assumptions built
into their systems. We particularly appreciate those presenters who
connect their work in a specific context to larger questions or
insights; such as, what qualifies as research software, and to what
degree research infrastructure “counts”; how community-driven
development with multiple stakeholders can be managed; the need to
develop research software in the context of specific projects with
expert collaborators; or that taking a new implementation approach for
pragmatic reasons can also be a fun technical challenge.</p>
<p>We recognize that the role and process for conference proceedings
varies by field, and that papers are typically peer-reviewed in advance
of the conference <span class="citation"
data-cites="10.63744@rWDzgqfDLYNm">(Arnold et al. 2025)</span>. We look
forward to having a proceedings publication option at the outset when
organizing future DHTech events, and will continue to refine guidelines
for authors and reviewers that are relevant and helpful for a diverse
range of technical work. As the conference and publication landscape for
digital and computational humanities continues to change, we will
continue to make space for presenting, publishing, and converations on
technical work in DH.</p>
