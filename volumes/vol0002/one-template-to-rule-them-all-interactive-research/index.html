<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction-and-project-background"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction and Project
Background</h1>
<p>The large-scale research project Stadt.Geschichte.Basel at the
University of Basel (2017–2026) aims to present Basel’s history through
a <a href="https://emono.unibas.ch/stadtgeschichtebasel/">ten-volume
book series</a>, a <a href="https://stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/">digital
portal</a>, and a dedicated <a
href="https://forschung.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/">research data
platform</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="goerlich2023">[<a
href="#ref-goerlich2023" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. As Team for
Research Data Management and Public History, we were tasked with
managing a vast range of historical research data produced by over fifty
authors working on the book series. From collection and organization to
long-term preservation and public dissemination, we worked with images
and figures, maps and geodata, tabular data and bibliographic references
provided by the authors or compiled by ourselves. The project mission
and goals as defined by the Canton of Basel-Stadt and the Foundation
Stadt.Geschichte.Basel placed emphasis on robust research data
management (RDM) and continuous public engagement. We created an <a
href="https://dokumentation.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/">online
documentation website</a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="maehr2024g">[<a href="#ref-maehr2024g"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span> to make our work on Basel’s
historical data publicly accessible, ensuring the project maintained
continuous public visibility and dialogue with future users even during
development. Key RDM work packages included securing the project’s
diverse data (spanning images, maps, figures, tabular data, geodata,
etc.) and developing interactive showcases for data presentation. We
decided that adhering to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) was critical for reproducibility <span
class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson2016">[<a
href="#ref-wilkinson2016" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>, especially
since historical scholarship to date lacks well-established
discipline-specific RDM guidelines <span class="citation"
data-cites="hiltmann2018 ruediger2023">[<a href="#ref-hiltmann2018"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a href="#ref-ruediger2023"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>. We also adopted minimal computing
tools like CollectionBuilder for digital collections, working with GLAM
institutions to translate research data into formats accessible to the
public <span class="citation" data-cites="mahr2023g">[<a
href="#ref-mahr2023g" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. This
comprehensive approach to RDM in a public history context underscored
the need for better workflows to document not just the data, but also
the processes and decisions behind the data <span class="citation"
data-cites="borgman2012">[<a href="#ref-borgman2012"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="developing-an-open-research-data-template"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Developing an Open Research Data
Template</h1>
<p>To implement best practices across the research data lifecycle, we
developed the <a
href="https://github.com/maehr/open-research-data-template">Open
Research Data Template</a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="mahr2023g">[<a href="#ref-mahr2023g"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>—a modular, GitHub-based framework
designed to streamline the publication, documentation, and reuse of open
research data.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The motivation arose from a common
challenge: even as more datasets are shared openly, the
<em>preprocessing steps, methodological decisions, and potential
pathways for reuse are often poorly documented</em>, rendering much
“open data” difficult to actually reuse. Our template directly addresses
this gap by enabling researchers (and our team) to package data with its
context and code, not in isolation.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="design-principles-and-technologies"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Design Principles and
Technologies</h2>
<p>The template is explicitly built around the guidelines from <a
href="https://book.the-turing-way.org/"><em>The Turing
Way</em></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="theturingwaycommunity2025">[<a
href="#ref-theturingwaycommunity2025" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>
to ensure that data and documentation are maximally reusable. Central to
the approach is <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>, an open-source
publishing system designed for reproducible research. Quarto is the
language-agnostic successor to RMarkdown and is built on Pandoc,
extending it with native support for literate programming across
multiple languages. Authors write in plain text (<code>.qmd</code>
files) combining Markdown, YAML metadata, and optional executable code
cells. At render time, Quarto executes these cells and weaves narrative,
code, and output into multiple formats (such as HTML websites, PDFs,
Word documents, or slides) from a single source.</p>
<p>Quarto’s key advantage is its ability to embed and execute code
chunks from Python, R, Julia, or JavaScript (Observable) within the same
document. This keeps narrative text, data analysis, and visualizations
in sync and reproducible. Compared with alternatives like Jupyter Book
or MkDocs, Quarto is lightweight, easier to configure for researchers,
and designed for scholarly publishing, with built-in support for
citations, cross-references, figure numbering, and multi-format output.
Specifically, the multi-language interoperability and automated
rendering features are heavily leveraged in our template to turn static
documentation into interactive, living resources.</p>
<p>We leveraged GitHub as both the development platform and the
publishing infrastructure.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Each project’s
repository can be based on the template, benefiting from automated
version control and collaboration. GitHub Actions (continuous
integration workflows) handle routine tasks such as building the site,
running tests (e.g., linting, validating links, generating changelogs,
etc.), and deploying updates to GitHub Pages for hosting. This means
that when contributors push changes (for example, updating a dataset or
its analysis code), the website regenerates automatically, ensuring the
latest information is always live without manual intervention. The
template also integrates with <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>
for long-term archiving: whenever a project using the template is ready
to publish a snapshot (for instance, alongside a paper or at a project
milestone), a Zenodo deposit can be generated, minting a DOI for that
version. This guarantees both accessibility and citability for the
materials, as datasets and documentation snapshots receive persistent
identifiers. By combining static webpages with archival DOIs, the
template bridges the gap between ephemeral project websites and
permanent scholarly records.</p>

Template</em> repository, demonstrating how to create a new repository,

</figure>
<p>A key innovation of our approach is treating documentation as a
living, executable environment rather than a static afterthought.
Traditionally, projects might release data as supplementary files and
methods as PDF documentation, but our template merges static metadata,
narrative descriptions, and executable code into a single integrated and
interactive website. This ensures that data, methods, and results remain
interconnected and in context <span class="citation"
data-cites="rule2019">[<a href="#ref-rule2019"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>. Anyone revisiting the project can
not only read about what was done but also see (and run) the actual code
that produced the results, all within the documentation. This
transparency lowers barriers to reuse: a future researcher can reproduce
or adapt the workflow in their environment, confident that nothing is
lost in translation. In essence, the template turns what would be static
data archives into “living, extensible resources,” continuously usable
and updatable beyond the original project.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="features-and-best-practices"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Features and Best
Practices</h2>
<p>The Open Research Data Template comes with a set of best practices
built in. It enforces a standardized, logical repository structure for
organizing data, code, and content, building on <em>The Turing Way</em>
handbook on reproducible research <span class="citation"
data-cites="theturingwaycommunity2025">[<a
href="#ref-theturingwaycommunity2025"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>. Key features include:</p>
<p> <strong>Executable Narratives.</strong> Authors can create documents
that directly incorporate code outputs (tables, plots, maps, etc.) into
the narrative. Quarto’s support for Jupyter and other kernels means the
documentation itself can regenerate analyses if data or parameters
change. This ensures that analysis results and figures are always in
sync with the latest data and code, exemplifying reproducible research
practices.</p>
<p> <strong>Automated Deployment and Testing.</strong> By using
continuous integration, the template reduces the technical overhead for
researchers. For example, when writing documentation in markdown or
Jupyter notebooks, authors simply commit their work; the template’s
GitHub Actions workflows then automatically runs any code (in a
controlled environment), builds the static site, checks for issues, and
publishes it. This encourages frequent updates and iterative improvement
without requiring web development expertise.</p>
<p> <strong>Integrated Archiving with DOI.</strong> The template
streamlines the process of archiving each release of a project. After
connecting Zenodo with GitHub during template initialization, a release
triggers the Zenodo integration to archive the full repository (data,
code, and site content) and issue a DOI. The live site can prominently
display these DOIs, signaling to visitors that they can cite a specific
version or access an immutable copy for reference. This was crucial for
us in an evolving long-term project, as it provides snapshots for future
historians to cite, even as the live documentation continues to
evolve.</p>
<p> <strong>Scalability and Consistency.</strong> Because the template
is a reusable scaffold, it brings consistency across projects. Every
project site built with it has a similar navigation and structure (with
sections for data, documentation, references, etc.), lowering the
learning curve for users. It also makes it easier to onboard new team
members or external collaborators to the project’s workflow. As we and
others have applied the template, we have benefited from community
feedback and contributions (via GitHub) that continue to refine the
template’s core. The result is a scalable solution that can fit small
one-off studies as well as large, multi-year collaborative projects.</p>
<p><br />
By adhering to these principles and features, the template provides a
practical model for elevating the standard of open data publication in
the Digital Humanities. It helps researchers move beyond minimal
compliance with open data mandates (i.e., just uploading files to a
repository) toward creating genuinely reusable and transparent research
outputs <span class="citation" data-cites="diekjobst2024a">[<a
href="#ref-diekjobst2024a" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>. In the
next section, we discuss how deploying this template across diverse use
cases has improved it and demonstrated its versatility.</p>
<h1 data-number="3"
id="applications-and-continuous-improvement-across-use-cases"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Applications and Continuous
Improvement Across Use Cases</h1>
<p>After developing the Open Research Data Template for our own needs in
Stadt.Geschichte.Basel, we adopted it in a variety of other contexts.
Each deployment provided an opportunity to test the template’s
flexibility and to refine features for broader applicability. Below, we
describe several use cases—ranging from documentation portals and
research repositories to teaching materials and digital
publications—highlighting the functionality enabled by the template and
the specific purposes each served.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="project-documentation"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Project Documentation</h2>
<p>At the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project, we needed a place for
documenting our work related to research data management and public
history in addition to the preexisting public history portal and
research data platform that focus on the project content and data
itself. To have a repository for archiving our products and showing them
to our peers, including more technical aspects of the project, we used
the template to create a <a
href="https://dokumentation.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch"><strong>documentation
platform</strong></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="maehr2024g">[<a
href="#ref-maehr2024g" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>. The site thus
serves as an evolving record of how we handle data and digital outputs
within the project and how we discuss it with our scientific peers. It
includes sections on data creation, annotation, publication, and reuse,
as well as our efforts in preparing historical content for digital
presentation. For instance, we showcase how our project’s research data
platform came to be, including documentation of our data model and the
results of web design performance audits. While our code itself is still
available on GitHub, the documentation platform serves as an enhanced
repository where design choices and programming workflows can be
explained in detail. By using our Quarto template, we could also provide
interactive and multiformat versions of our products to make it easier
to grasp their main features, rendering them easily reusable in other
projects. During the project, our team participated in numerous
presentations and publications discussing our work within the academic
community. Each talk, paper, poster, etc. is also archived on this
platform: abstracts, slides, and literature references are made
available in one place, enabling cross-referencing in the future, with
long-term access ensured by integrating Zenodo in our documentation
workflow, including registered DOIs and external file storage.</p>

</figure>
<p>For the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project, we created a <a
href="https://forschung.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/">research data
platform</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="goerlich2023">[<a
href="#ref-goerlich2023" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> to provide
project-related, annotated research data, including dozens of scientific
illustrations created with ggplot2 in R. The plots are made available on
this platform, but we wanted to ensure access to the underlying R code
as well. We could have uploaded the R code to the platform, but we did
not want to push our less tech-savvy main audience (historians) away
with uncontextualized source code, and we wanted the code to be 100%
reproducible. To publish the plots including a reproducible
workflow—from raw data to a PDF export of each plot—we created the <a
href="https://dokumentation.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/sgb-figures"><strong>sgb-figures</strong></a>
GitHub repository <span class="citation" data-cites="twente2025c">[<a
href="#ref-twente2025c" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span> with our
template. This repository provides a reproducible environment with raw
data and scripts for processing, plotting, annotating, and exporting the
available illustrations. Each plot is linked from our research data
platform. With the publication of our data and workflow, we made it
possible for interested users to tweak parameters, add data, or reuse
our dataset for other analyses.</p>

<p>A similar example is a repository containing voting data of members
of the Danish Parliament, Folketing. The dataset itself is published in
the GitHub repository <a
href="http://mtwente.github.io/nordatlantisk-ft"><strong>nordatlantisk-ft</strong></a> <span
class="citation" data-cites="twente2024a">[<a href="#ref-twente2024a"
role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>, including the workflow to scrape
the voting data from Folketinget’s API, to combine different variables
into one dataset, and to create a few exploratory visualizations. Using
the template, we structured the repository according to best practices
following an advanced structure recommended by <em>The Turing
Way</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="theturingwaycommunity2025">[<a
href="#ref-theturingwaycommunity2025"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>, with a clear folder structure for
raw data, processed data, analysis scripts, and documentation, including
a codebook for all variables. The site also integrates external
resources like a Zotero bibliography of relevant sources, which
demonstrates how contextual information can be linked to the dataset.
The template’s flexibility allows for including a short descriptive
report on the data with self-updating, interactive plots as an integral
part of the site, providing an initial overview of the data without
delving into the data structure itself. The GitHub repository enables
users to rerun the data scraping workflow themselves by making use of
both R and GitHub features such as reproducible environments with R
targets and Codespaces. Using GitHub Actions, the dataset can be updated
at fixed time intervals, including uploads to Zenodo, without the need
for manual intervention. By encapsulating this in the template, such
maintenance tasks become standardized across projects.</p>

<p>Even for projects that do not consist of one executable workflow, the
template is useful for documenting what steps were taken to compile the
research data to be published. Quarto’s multi-language capabilities make
it possible to document processing steps in written text, and, using
flowcharts, also in a visually appealing way. Take the data repository
<a
href="https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis"><strong>maxvogt-analysis</strong></a> <span
class="citation" data-cites="twente2024">[<a href="#ref-twente2024"
role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> for example. In this project,
spatial data and design attributes of railway station architecture in
Switzerland were collected to conduct a study in urban design history.
While photographs were archived on Wikimedia Commons, a separate
location was needed to also store about fifty geojson files to provide
results of urban morphology analyses. Using the Quarto template, it was
not only possible to check the geodata into version control, but also to
provide documentation on the data source and workflow in Markdown. A
notable use of the template here was embedding a Mermaid.js diagram
outlining the analysis workflow from data collection to analysis steps
directly in the documentation. This diagram offers a quick visual
understanding of how the research was conducted, complementing the
textual description. By hosting the data and the Python analysis code
together, the site becomes a one-stop resource for others interested in
this approach to spatial analysis of architectural history. They can see
the exact steps taken, map outputs, and even use the geodata in GIS or
for interactive online maps using Leaflet.js.</p>

<p>The possibility to add multimedia content to the research data
documentation is also part of the project <a
href="https://mtwente.github.io/modelling-marti"><strong>Modelling
Marti</strong></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="twente2025b">[<a
href="#ref-twente2025b" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>, in which
topic modeling was applied to newspaper articles by Hans Marti, a
pioneer of spatial planning in Switzerland. While the GitHub repository
behind the Quarto website again stores the harvested data consisting of
segmented text in txt and csv files, including metadata, it allows for a
publication focused on narrative elements and context as well. The site
reads like an extended article: It lays out the research questions,
methods (article scraping, data cleaning, topic modeling), and the
results with exploratory charts and tables. However, unlike a
traditional paper, it includes the underlying code for topic modeling or
word frequency analysis inline using R, which readers can inspect or
even replicate with tweaked parameters. By employing the template, we
turned what could have been a static PDF into an interactive
publication. Interactive maps using Leaflet.js and historic photographs
embedded from ETH Zürich’s <a
href="https://e-pics3.ethz.ch/de/home/">e-pics catalogue</a> enhance the
reading experience by turning the data repository into a narrative,
data-driven publication. It also serves as a proof of concept that
academic publications in history can be made more transparent and
reproducible without sacrificing narrative clarity.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.3" id="conference-and-teaching-platforms"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Conference and Teaching
Platforms</h2>
<p>The Open Research Data Template has proven useful beyond traditional
research data documentation, notably in academic event and course
contexts. We deployed the template for the <a
href="https://digihistch24.github.io/"><strong>Digital History
Switzerland 2024 conference</strong></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="baudry2024b">[<a href="#ref-baudry2024b"
role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>. Here, the template was used to
publish the <em>book of abstracts</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="baudry2024a">[<a href="#ref-baudry2024a"
role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span> as an interactive digital
publication. Each abstract is a short, citable publication with
references, some accompanied by dynamically generated visualizations.
The site not only provided information to conference attendees but now
also serves as a preserved record of the event, with DOIs ensuring each
abstract is citable and archived using Zenodo. By utilizing our
template, we ensured that the process of compiling, formatting, and
publishing the abstracts was largely automated and consistent, enabling
researchers unfamiliar with Quarto and markdown to contribute to the
book of abstracts. Thanks to the template, we are also independent of
the university’s conference management tools, which are not designed to
be a long-term archivable resource. Presenters submitted their abstracts
(some with code snippets, bibliography files, or data links) as
Markdown, which we integrated into the Quarto-based site. The inclusion
of executable snippets allowed presenters in computational history to
share live examples alongside their abstract text, something not
possible in a static PDF. This use case demonstrated that the template
can handle multi-author content and still maintain overall cohesion and
quality control via versioning and automated checks.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a different vein, the <a
href="https://dhbern.github.io/"><strong>Digital Humanities Bern (DH
Bern) website</strong></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="digitalhumanitiesbern2025">[<a
href="#ref-digitalhumanitiesbern2025"
role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> was created with the template to
serve as a hub for the University of Bern’s DH projects and activities.
Unlike the focused research cases above, this website aggregates various
content types: blog posts, project descriptions, and event
announcements. The template’s flexibility allowed us to support all
these content types within one site. For example, the portal features an
events calendar, and a blog where each post can include interactive
elements (one post visualized the timeline of DH projects at the
university using an embedded chart). By building the site on the
template, the DH Bern team benefits from the same maintainability—any
content update triggers a site rebuild, and the site’s static hosting
means it is low maintenance. In addition, the portal harmonizes multiple
projects and methodologies in a single framework. For instance, if one
project is an online database and another is a mapping tool, their
documentation on the portal can both use interactive code cells to show
usage examples, providing a unified user experience. The success of this
portal indicates that our template can double as a general-purpose
static site generator for academic groups, not just data-specific
projects.</p>

data-cites="huber2024">[<a href="#ref-huber2024"

and Moritz Mähr taught at the University of Bern for Digital Humanities
students in 2025, using the template. This site hosted lecture notes,
datasets for student exercises, and an interactive bibliography on
machine learning and social inequality. Moreover, the contributions of
the students were uploaded as well, turning the site into a
collaborative space. The static nature of the deployed site means that
it was reliable and fast for students to access, and although the course
ended, it remains a publicly accessible resource.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.4" id="living-publications-and-handbooks"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Living Publications and
Handbooks</h2>
<p>One of the most significant outcomes of our work has been the
creation of a “living handbook” on <a
href="https://maehr.github.io/diskriminierungsfreie-metadaten/"><strong>Non-discriminatory
Metadata</strong></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="maehr2024d">[<a
href="#ref-maehr2024d" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]</span> for
historical collections. This handbook, published in 2024 by Moritz Mähr
and Noëlle Schnegg, was built using the template and exemplifies how
scholarly documents can remain dynamic. The handbook provides guidelines
and case studies on creating inclusive, non-discriminatory metadata in
cultural heritage and research contexts. Because it is built with our
template, it is not a static PDF but a multiformat publication that can
continuously evolve. In fact, it is explicitly intended as a “Living
Document” open to continuous community development. The site allows
readers to not only read the guidelines but also see examples of
metadata records, some of which are interactive (e.g., forms or JSON
examples that users can toggle). We included a discussion forum via the
GitHub issues integration, inviting feedback or contributions from
librarians, archivists, and others in the community. Notably, we took
advantage of Quarto’s multi-format output capabilities to release the
handbook in multiple formats from the same source: an HTML website, a
downloadable PDF, and even a Word document for those who prefer or
require that format. All of these formats are generated automatically,
ensuring consistency between them. The template’s DOI integration was
used to archive a version of the handbook on Zenodo at the time of
official release, giving it a citable reference. However, the online
version continues to be updated with new examples and clarifications as
the field evolves. This use case underlines how the template supports
sustainability and accessibility: by making the handbook a static site,
it remains accessible long-term (no dependency on a complex database or
CMS), and by archiving versions, we balance the living nature with
scholarly referenceability.</p>

<figcaption>Handbook page for creating non-discriminatory metadata for

</figure>
<p>Finally, in a meta-turn, we even used the Open Research Data Template
to create the <a
href="https://maehr.github.io/one-template-to-rule-them-all/"><strong>presentation
site</strong></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="mahr2025h">[<a
href="#ref-mahr2025h" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span> for this very
paper, <em>One Template to Rule Them All</em>. The talk’s slides were
prepared in Quarto, allowing us to generate a Reveal.js HTML slideshow
for live presentation and a PowerPoint deck for backup, all from the
same content source. This demonstrated that the template (and Quarto by
extension) can easily switch output formats—in this case, from an
interactive website to presentation slides—a boon for efficiency
overall. The presentation site itself is hosted on GitHub Pages, and it
includes live examples of the template’s features in action. In using
the template for the talk, we validated its utility in yet another
format and identified a few minor improvements, such as better default
slide styles, that we are planning to incorporate into the template for
future users. In other words, we ate our own dog food.</p>

</figure>
<p>Across all these use cases, a pattern emerges: the Open Research Data
Template helped make sound RDM and open science practices easier to
implement by packaging them into a reusable toolkit. Whether it was a
large public history project, a standalone dataset publication, a
collaborative handbook, or a course website, the template provided a
backbone to ensure that the outputs were accessible, reproducible, and
sustainable. Each deployment also fed back into the project. For
example, the need to support multiple output formats became clear with
the handbook and presentation, which led us to refine how the template’s
configuration handled HTML, PDF, and Word generation as well as slides.
In this way, continuous use has been a form of continuous
development.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5"
id="the-templates-role-in-peer-reviewed-scholarship"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5</span> The Template’s Role in
Peer-Reviewed Scholarship</h2>
<p>A crucial aspect of the Open Research Data Template is its ability to
bridge the gap between dynamic, web-based project documentation and
formal, peer-reviewed academic outputs. The websites and repositories
created with the template are not merely informal supplements; they are
integral components of the scholarly record that can complement,
facilitate, or even constitute a form of peer-reviewed publication.</p>
<p>First, the template provides a robust framework for creating citable
supplementary material that vastly exceed the scope of traditional
“supplementary information” files. When a researcher submits a journal
article or book chapter based on data analysis, the corresponding
template-based website can be cited directly in the publication using
its Zenodo-minted DOI. This allows readers to move seamlessly from the
static argument in the paper to an interactive environment where they
can explore the data, examine the analysis code, and verify the results.
This model of publication enhances transparency and reproducibility,
allowing peer reviewers and future researchers to engage with the work
on a much deeper level than a PDF alone would permit.</p>
<p>Second, the template can facilitate a more transparent and rigorous
peer-review process. By sharing a link to the repository with reviewers,
authors can provide access to the entire research workflow. Reviewers
can not only assess the final narrative but also inspect the raw data,
run the code in a reproducible environment like a Codespace, and trace
the project’s development through its version history. This open
approach transforms peer review from a simple evaluation of a final
product into a more comprehensive audit of the research process itself,
aligning with the growing demand for accountability in computational
research.</p>
<p>Finally, projects built with the template can function as standalone
scholarly publications in their own right, challenging traditional
publication models. The “living handbook” on <em>Non-discri­mi­na­tory
Metadata</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="maehr2024d">[<a
href="#ref-maehr2024d" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]</span> serves as a
prime example. While it was not subjected to a conventional double-blind
peer-review process, its publication on GitHub invites continuous open
community review through the platform’s issues and pull request
features. This model treats scholarship as an ongoing conversation
rather than a finished artifact. Furthermore, the template is ideally
suited for producing data and software papers, a growing genre of
peer-reviewed articles focused on describing a scholarly resource. The
structured documentation, embedded code, and contextual narrative
generated by the template provide the exact content required for
submission to journals like the <em>Journal of Open Humanities
Data</em>. In this context, the template does not just support a
publication; it helps generate its core substance. By formalizing the
connection between data, process, and narrative, the template helps
legitimize these essential research outputs as first-class academic
contributions.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Our experience with the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project and the
subsequent development of the Open Research Data Template highlights the
value of making robust, interactive documentation a standard component
of research data management. By lowering technical barriers, we made it
as easy as possible for researchers (and ourselves) to follow best
practices in open data: the template abstracts the complexities of web
publishing, reproducibility, and archiving into a user-friendly
workflow. This means historians and humanities scholars, who might not
be seasoned programmers, can still produce state-of-the-art research
outputs that are transparent and reusable. In particular, the use of
portable, and static-site technology (Quarto + GitHub Pages) contributes
to sustainability (noting that while we do lock into the Microsoft
universe by using GitHub as a platform, we also help cement its place as
a de facto marketplace for open source code). Static sites are
lightweight, secure (no moving parts on the server), and likely to
remain accessible years into the future with minimal maintenance. They
can be archived in repositories like Zenodo, preserving not just the
data but the complete context needed to understand and reuse that data.
For some researchers, the technical details of working with Git and
GitHub will still present a challenge. But in our experience, the
template structure is easy to grasp thanks to comprehensive instructions
and an initialization checklist. The use of partly automated workflows,
for example during code review and site deployment, helped Git newcomers
in our team to get used to this workflow and version control in
general.</p>
<p>In sum, good interactive documentation is not an added bonus but a
fundamental part of making research data truly open and useful. Our
template empowers projects to create “living” documentation that keeps
data, code, and narrative in sync, which we believe is a key ingredient
for impactful and reproducible Digital Humanities research. The positive
reception and diverse adoption of the template across use cases indicate
that this approach resonates with the needs of the community. We argue
that initiatives like ours help shift the culture toward treating
research outputs as dynamic resources to be explored and built upon,
rather than static end products. By combining modern open-source tools
and best practices, and by focusing on ease of use, we hope to see more
researchers embrace these methods. Ultimately, making open research data
practices easy and even automatic frees scholars to focus on the content
of their research, while ensuring that their work can endure, be
understood, and inspire future work in the years to come.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The template has evolved through several distinct
phases. The project’s foundation was established in early 2023 with the
creation of the initial template, core documentation and Zenodo
integration for archiving purposes. This was followed by a phase of
enhancements focusing on bug fixes, improving user instructions and
managing dependency updates. From late 2023 to mid-2024, the project
underwent a period of major evolution, including renaming, adopting a
dual AGPL-3.0 and CC BY 4.0 licence, and switching to Quarto as the
primary documentation system. In early 2025, DevOps processes were
improved with enhanced GitHub Actions workflows for automated linting
and deployment. Most recently, in mid-2025, a modern development phase
introduced DevContainer support and GitHub Codespaces integration to
streamline the development environment. The template is now stable, with
a v1.0.0 release planned for the fourth quarter of 2025.<a

<li id="fn2"><p>A migration to GitLab is technically feasible. Core
repository data (files, history, issues, wikis) can be imported with low
effort, but continuous integration workflows require a full rewrite of
GitHub Actions into GitLab’s <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>. Dependency
updates, security scanning, and GitHub Pages equivalents also need
reconfiguration.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
